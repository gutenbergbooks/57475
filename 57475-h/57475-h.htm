<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The gallant Morgan has said that our independence is an achieved fact. “Privation
and suffering have won it.” It is true that the noble South has been deprived
of many of its wonted necessaries, not to say luxuries, by the present invasion
of those disciples of Satan, commonly called “Yankees.” Paper, among
other things, is scarce in the South, and paper may be turned into excellent account
in the composition of cartridges, while metal that might be moulded into
bullets is run into type. Yet newspapers and books are printed, and most of
them eagerly read, especially any that have the most remote bearing upon the present
contest. In these stern times of war’s realities, plain facts challenge our attention
rather than the gaudy fiction of novels. Honey from Mount Hybla, or
Nectar from Olympus, would fail on the palate, unless relieved by homelier viands;
and it would certainly require considerable stoicism to sit down to a tale of imaginary
woes and sorrows while one great wail is going up from our sick and
wounded—an incredible amount of apathy to sit leisurely down to such a book under
the shade of a tree while the nation is sending out a heartcry for reinforcements to
our brave legions, in order to <em>speedily</em> defeat the unscrupulous enemy. This little
book is intended as, and professes no more than a plain statement of facts, so
that others may learn what I have read, seen and heard, without undergoing
the pain of incarceration in the hands of Yankees, whose tyranny increases in proportion
to the power they possess over their victims.</p>

<h2><a name="EXPERIENCE" id="EXPERIENCE"></a>EXPERIENCE<br />
<span class="xs">OF A</span><br />
CONFEDERATE STATES PRISONER.</h2>


<p><i>May, 1862.</i> A “heavy march” on the 6th and 7th instant
resulted in a Confederate victory at McDowell, Highland county,
at which place a battle was fought on the 8th. General Jackson
routed and drove the enemy, commanded by the Yankee
Generals, Milroy and Schenck, twenty-five miles into Pendleton
county, and captured a large amount of ammunition, commissary
stores, arms, and many prisoners. Our forces afterwards
completely routed Banks’ column at Winchester, and thoroughly
defeated Fremont and Shields at Cross Keyes and Port Republic.
After the battle at Front Royal, I remained at that place upon
the recommendation of the regimental surgeon, on account of
having strong symptoms of the Typhoid fever, which turned
out to be the genuine disease. Dr. Brown, the resident physician,
attended me; and a member of my own company, Mr.
Oxford, nursed me faithfully from the 23d May, the day our
forces entered Front Royal, to the 30th May, the day that the
Yankees under General Shields recaptured it. The 12th Georgia
regiment was the only force left at Front Royal. The
Provost Marshal, or the Colonel commanding the 12th Georgia,
gave us notice but <em>one hour</em> before the Yankees were in the
town that they were advancing. When Mr. Oxford informed
me of the near approach of the Yankees, I quickly jumped out
of bed, and we hastily made a retreat towards Winchester. The
salutary and kind attentions of Dr. Brown and Mr. Oxford had
much improved me in strength, but I soon discovered that I
could not keep pace with the latter in our eager efforts to escape.
We succeeded in getting about one mile and a half from the
town when the Yankee cavalry were heard closing on us so fast
that we leaped over a fence on the left of the road, thinking
that we might conceal ourselves in the high grass until the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
cavalry passed, and be enabled to elude them by getting into the
woods near by. In the confusion, however, Mr. Oxford and I
became separated, and by this time the Yankee cavalry were
close enough to fire twice on myself and two others from the
33d Virginia, who attempted to make their escape in the same
direction. The cavalry soon after had surrounded us, and we
were compelled to surrender, and were marched into town under
a heavy guard. The commissioned officers were carried before
General Shields, and the non-commissioned officers and privates
to the building used by our army as a hospital, where we had
some hundred sick at the time. The commissioned officers at
first confined to any house they might select, were afterwards
paroled the town. I was taken to Mr. John B. Petty’s house,
and ordered to remain there “for the present” by one of General
Shields’ staff. About an hour after I was left at the above
named house, a Pennsylvania Major came into the room where
I was, and very abruptly asked me, “What are you doing here?”
I informed him that by order of General Shields I was to remain
there “until further orders;” he would not believe me, and
placed <em>two</em> sentinels in the room until he found that my statement
was correct. Captain Keogh (on General Shields’ staff)
gave me the following note, saying, when he did so, that I would
not be “any further annoyed by officers in other regiments”
that had nothing to do with my case:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">
“<span class="smcap">Headquarters, Shields’ Division, May 30, 1862.</span>
</p>

<p>“Captain W. is allowed to remain at the house of Mr. John B. Petty (until further
arrangements are made,) the said Captain W. being a prisoner of war. By
order of Major General Shields.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="rgap2">MILES W. KEOGH,</span><br />
<i>Ass’t Adj.</i>”
</p></blockquote>

<p>After the lapse of two days I was allowed the limits of the
town, but being sick I did not go out of the house for five days
after I was captured, when I walked down to the barbers’ shop.
While passing the hotel I was called by a Federal officer, whose
name I learned afterwards was General Duryea, of New York.
I went into his room, around which were sitting several other
Federal officers, and the General addressed me, “What are you
doing walking about the streets? Are you not a Southern
officer?” I replied “I am,” and told him that Major Shedd,
the Provost Marshal, had paroled me the town. General Duryea
then said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span> “I understand, sir, that when the Rhode Island
cavalry had you in their power, and could have killed you, that
as one of the cavalry dismounted to take your sword, and
was proceeding to mount again, you fired your pistol twice at
the back of his neck.” I replied such could not be true, for I
had no pistol about me when captured. General Duryea then
said, “I may be mistaken, but I wish to find out what Captain
it was, and visit the proper vengeance upon him.” The day
before the Yankees entered Front Royal, a colored man died of
small pox in a small frame house near the railroad depot, and by
general consent of both citizens and the Yankee paroled prisoners
in the town, it was agreed as advisable to burn the house
and body, in order to prevent the spread of the dangerous and
contagious disease. The Yankees were told by some traitor,
or else themselves originated the lie, that we had burned up two
of the Yankee prisoners in our hands, and they swore vengeance
against us—declared that they intended to “put the town in
ashes,” and nothing but a special order of General Shields to the
contrary, and forbidding interference with any property whatever,
prevented the soldiers from giving vent to spleen engendered
by a false and malicious report. General Shields was informed
by Major Collins, (Vermont cavalry,) in my presence, that while
a prisoner in our hands he was treated most kindly, and that all
reports to the contrary had no foundation in truth; and all the
other Federal prisoners endorsed the statement of Major Collins.</p>

<p><i>June 6th.</i> We have been told from day to day that all “General
Jackson’s men” would be paroled until exchanged, and
yet at the same time preparations are being made to take us to
Washington, <i>i. e.</i>, about nineteen officers, and one hundred and
fifty non-commissioned officers and privates. The kindness of
the people of Front Royal, and especially the ladies to the Confederate
prisoners, deserves the highest praise. Devoted to our
cause, they omit no opportunity to show their regard for those
who are endeavoring to rescue them from the obnoxious presence
and depredations of the Yankees. They keep aloof from the
Yankees as much as possible, and are always on the alert to do
something for the relief of our sick and wounded.</p>

<p><i>June 7th.</i> Among the Yankees I made the acquaintance of
Adjutant Griffin, 5th New York cavalry, who treated me kindly,
as also Captain Abraham Moore, Captain Isaac S. Tichenor,
and Major Shedd, 105th New York regiment, and Lieutenant
H. Hobert Mason, of General McDowell’s staff. Met with the
celebrated Miss “Bell Boyd” to-day. Miss B. is a sprightly, intelligent
lady, <i lang="fr">au fait</i> in all the movements of our army, and
moderately good looking. Her general information, and nonchalant
mode of fluent conversation, renders her <i lang="fr">tout ensemble</i>
quite interesting. <em>It is said</em> she has obtained valuable information
from Yankee officers in regard to their movements, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
conveyed the same to our army. A great many soldiers talk to
me every day, and they all so far have expressed themselves tired
of the war, but say that it will soon be ended, inasmuch as they
have General Jackson “in a trap,” out of which he cannot
escape. They say “Stonewall” is our greatest General—incomparably
so—that he is cunning and strategic, but that it is not
within the range of human possibility for him “to elude us this
time;” that they would like to capture him, but under no consideration
would they kill either him or Ashby if they knew it.</p>

<p><i>June 8th.</i> They say we are to be sent to Washington city on
to-morrow, but we have been told so many things that have failed
to come to pass, that we are too reluctant to believe any more
reports. <i lang="fr">Nous verron</i>, to-morrow. Mr. and Mrs. Petty have
been untiring in their attentions to the sick and wounded prisoners
here. They will never be forgotten by those who have been
the recipients of their kindness, especially those who had the
fortune to be under their roof. Mr. P. has been made to pay the
Yankees a heavy penalty on account of being “Secesh;” they
have stolen three of his most valuable negroes, any number of
horses, cattle, &amp;c., besides laying waste his two farms. One of
his negro men left him one day, and the next time he saw him
the negro was dressed in the cavalry uniform, with a sabre hanging
to his side, and passed his master with silent contempt on
the street. The negro was now a member of the “Michigan
cavalry,” a company notorious for its success in robbery and
plunder of every description. This same negro visited Mr.
Petty’s house afterwards in company with three Yankee officers,
and demanded of Mrs. Petty (Mr. P. was absent) the key to the
wine room; Mrs. P. told them that she had only a few bottles of
wine, which she kept for medicinal purposes, and requested them
not to disturb it, but the negro persisted with threats in having
it, and told Mrs. P. “she lied” in saying she only had a few bottles.
Having obtained all the wine in the house, by frightening
this excellent lady they drank it in her presence, when they
smashed the bottles on the floor, exclaiming, “the damned
Secesh don’t deserve to have anything.”</p>

<p><i>Monday, June 9th.</i> To-day the prisoners were put on the
cars to be taken to Washington city. A lady gave one of the
prisoners a boquet with a small Confederate flag attached, which,
as he was about to get into the cars, was noticed by General
Duryea, of New York, and as soon as the latter saw it he quickly
severed the flag from the boquet, and with an air of contempt
and triumph tore it into fragments, at the same time trampling
each fragment under his feet. The people of Front Royal manifest
the greatest interest in the Confederate prisoners. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
carry provisions to them daily at the hospital, while those prisoners
who are paroled are invited to their houses. It would seem
that interest would sometimes prompt them to court Yankee
favor, but they spurn it, and remain loyal and true in their deportment
at the sacrifice of thousands of dollars worth of property,
for Yankee regiments camp on the wheat fields, and steal
the horses and negroes, and kill the hogs, and commit every sort
of depredation upon the property of those who are known to be
Secessionists. The ladies avoid the Yankees whenever they can,
and when thrown into their presence, treat them with that reserve
with which they might be expected to treat those whom
they regard as the deadly enemies of their dearest friends and
interest, but whose presence they cannot avoid. The people
seemed sad when the prisoners left Front Royal; the ladies
filled their haversacks with refreshments, and loaded the cars
with flowers.</p>

<p><i>June 10th.</i> We arrived at Alexandria at 2 o’clock this morning—saw
the depot which was burned by the bold General
Geary, when he <em>imagined</em> that he saw 50,000 rebels advancing
on him, when, in fact, the rebels were no where near him. The
104th New York regiment in their fright burned up everything
they had. A fellow prisoner informs me that he was lately a
prisoner in the hands of Geary, who had him hand-cuffed, and
kept him without food for four days, and that he led his command
to believe, by repeated assurances, that Richmond was in
possession of the Federal army. At daybreak this morning a
crowd assembled around the cars, and many were eager to talk
with us, but were not permitted to do so. Nor were our friends
allowed to give us anything to eat, although they had provided
various refreshments, and although the Yankees had furnished
us nothing to eat since yesterday morning, or it may be
said with nothing at all, for what we eat <em>then</em> was given by the
people at Front Royal. At 7 o’clock in the morning the crowd
became very great, and the guards were increased in proportion.
The ladies could not be prevented from kissing their hands to
the prisoners. A young man attempted to throw an orange in
the cars for a lady, who requested him to do so, but he was contemptuously
thrust aside, and had to leave in “double quick”
time. Our friends had provided for us coffee, bread and butter,
ham, eggs, cakes, pies, candies in variety, and tobacco and cigars
in profusion, but like the thirsty Tantalus, and the water we
were almost in reach, without being able to enjoy them. Boquets
were thrown in showers into the cars, while there was the
greatest demand for our buttons. Some cut all the buttons off
their coats, and then could not gratify all who requested to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
given “one.” This scene, and the sympathy manifested for our
cause by so many Alexandrians, made us feel happy, while at
the same time we were sad in knowing that they were then
writhing under the heel of Lincoln despotism. The Yankee soldiers
seemed to envy the attentions sought to be lavished upon
the prisoners by the people of Alexandria; some cursed us,
some shook the United States flag in our faces, &amp;c. One fellow
remarked, “If the 11th Massachusetts was in those cars, you
would not get to Washington city.” Others vented their spleen
by insulting remarks to the ladies. We arrived at Washington
at 12, M., having started from Alexandria in a steamboat about
11. We were then marched in two ranks (with a strong guard
of infantry on either side and rear, and a display of cavalry in
front) to the “old capitol military prison.” We were very wet
when we arrived at the latter place, on account of the rain which
commenced before we left the steamboat, but were compelled to
stand out in the yard from 12, M., to 5, P.M., when we were
assigned our quarters. The room in which seven officers and
myself were confined was about twelve feet square. My prison
companions are Captain Samuel M. Sommers, quartermaster,
Lieutenants Chas. E. Bott and John F. Everly, 33d Virginia
regiment, and Lieutenant James K. Decrow, Newton T. Johnston,
James M. Brown, and Edward Waterman, of the 12th
Georgia regiment. Roll was called to-night, and our names,
rank, regiment, company letter, and State, taken in full. Our
door is locked all the time, except when officers come in, or when
we are allowed to go into the yard an half hour for exercise.</p>

<p><i>June 11th.</i> The superintendent of this prison is William P.
Wood, and the officers in command Captain Benjamin Higgins,
and Lieutenants J. Miller and —— Holmes. Mr. Wood is an
infidel, who so far from blushing to proclaim it, takes frequent
occasion to do so. When endeavoring to enforce his doctrines,
he addresses his opponent as “You mullet-headed Christian,”
and speaks in the greatest derision of our Saviour, while he denies
the existence of a God, or hell. He is a sharp-featured,
serpentine-looking specimen of humanity, medium height, and
by trade a cabinet maker, before his black republican proclivities
secured him his present position. Mr. Wood, a prisoner, soon
finds out to be the most important among “the powers that be”
connected with the prison, and all “privileges” must be reached
through him. He professes to be a great Southern man, and
sometimes demonstrates this by knocking down a contraband,
who does not wait upon him in accordance with his fastidious
notions.</p>

<p>It is cloudy, and my close confinement, together with the con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>tinual
sight of dark blue uniforms makes me feel as gloomy as
the sky is in appearance. I would that I could be with our army
in the “Old Dominion.” From my prison window I see an old
United States soldier cultivating flowers in a row of flower pots.
One knows him to be a soldier by his regular walk, and the
style of his grey moustache, not to speak of his uniform. Indeed
one might have guessed as much from the care he takes of
his little garden, for there are two things I have noticed especially,
loved by old soldiers, viz: flowers and children. They
have so long been obliged to look upon the earth as a field of battle,
and so long cut off from the peaceful pleasures of a quiet
lot, that they seem to begin life at an age when others end it.</p>

<p><i>June 12th.</i> Have been here a day and a half and two nights,
and can form some idea of the way things are managed at this
prison. Roll is called night and morning, and as to fare, we are
allowed a tin cup of what is called coffee, but which is really
mock-coffee, a slice of bread six inches long, five inches wide, and
a quarter of an inch thick, and a piece of beef or fat bacon twice
a day—forming a repast, the sight of which is almost enough to
cause any respectable stomach to revolt, so unclean seems both
it and its surroundings. A lady came into our room to-day leaning
on the arm of Dr. Stewart, the prison surgeon. As the Doctor
ushered her in, he remarked, “This is the room in which
Mrs. Rose O. N. Greenhow was confined.” Lieutenant D., of
the 12th Georgia regiment, was lying on a blanket in one corner
of the room, and the lady seemed to recognise him, and asked
“What’s your name?” “Are you from Georgia?” Being answered
promptly by the Lieutenant, and in the affirmative as to
the latter question, the surgeon observed, “You have a remarkable
recollection of faces,” and they left the room, which was
then quickly locked. It is supposed that she is the correspondent
of some Northern journal. No doubt she will say that we
live in a palace, and have hotel fare, thus emulating the editor
of the “Evening Star,” who a short time ago informed its readers
that we “fared equal to any hotel in the city.” If a sentinel
is caught in conversation with a prisoner, the punishment is
two weeks in chains. The prisoners are allowed an half hour in
the yard after each meal. After dinner to-day, the surgeon, Dr.
Stewart, a coarse, vulgar mean Yankee came among us in the
yard, and had the audacity to say, “All who desire to take the
oath of allegiance to the United States Government, and thereby
obtain their liberty step this way.” A deserter and two men
of Northern birth obeyed the call. I am informed by prisoners,
who have been here sometime, that the greatest effort is constantly
made to induce prisoners to take the infamous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span> “oath of
allegiance.” At roll call to-night I was informed that “several
friends” called to see me. I was not told who the friends are,
and I infer that they do not intend to tell me, or allow me to see
them at all.</p>

<p><i>Friday, June 13th.</i> Among the prisoners confined here, is
Charles C. Randolph, Esq., a venerable looking old gentleman,
seventy-five years of age, from Fauquier county, Virginia. He
served in the war of 1812 as Captain, under General Parks’
command, and received his commission through the influence of
the celebrated “Harry Lightfoot Lee,” of the revolution. He
says that he went to Richmond about the first of April last, and
when he returned to his home he found that the Yankees had
devastated everything about his valuable premises. They stole
his horses, sheep and cattle, and destroyed his crops, and took
everything of value he had from a library worth $5,000, to his
bed, and even his wife’s likeness, and the family bible, besides
breaking all the hinges of the doors, and committing waste and
robbery generally. He, himself, was arrested as soon as he arrived
home, and brought here, for what he knows not, unless it
be for implied sympathy for the cause of the soil of his birth
and the people of his blood. There was a prisoner here named
Wharton, a Californian. He was a Lieutenant in the United
States Navy at the beginning of the war, when he resigned, and
started for the South via Washington city, but was arrested on
his arrival here and brought to this prison. A short time since
he cursed one of the sentinels for insulting language used towards
him, when the sentinel called for the “corporal of the guard,”
who being equally insolent, was in turn treated in the same way
by Lieutenant Wharton. The “officer of the guard” was then
called, who proving equally offensive in language to Lieutenant
W., the latter cursed him in the heat of anger, whereupon said
Lieutenant Wharton was shot, and soon afterwards died of his
wounds. A respectable gentleman, Mr. Stewart of Maryland,
who was incarcerated here, was promised by the guard to be
allowed to escape, on condition of the payment of $50; but
although the sentinel pocketed the money, when Mr. Stewart was
effecting his escape the sentinel shot him, and this sentinel was
immediately promoted from a private to a sergeant.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, June 14th, 1862.</i> It is reported this morning that
Colonel Ashby is killed, and General “Stonewall” Jackson a
prisoner, and the Yankees profess to place great reliance upon
the report. From Northern sources, I learn that when the war-tax
was being collected in Southern Illinois, it required three
regiments to accomplish the task. It seems plain that Southern
Illinois would like to break the chains that now bind her. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
the beginning of the war the people of that section were told by
Yankees that wished to raise regiments of soldiers to fight us,
<em>that the Mississippi would be blocked against them</em>, when the
very first act of the Confederate Congress insured the free navigation
of the Mississippi river.</p>

<p>The Yankees say that by the first of July their public debt
will be 650 million dollars! It is now 1,500 millions!! They
have 65,000 sick from their own account. Who will pay their
pensions?</p>

<p>This is a struggle on the side of the Yankees for supremacy,
and on our side for independence. It is urged that the Northern
States are a great deal stronger than the Southern States,
and therefore must win in this contest. England was a great
deal stronger than Scotland, but when it was the object of England
to establish by force a supremacy over Scotland, they found
the Scotch very ugly customers. In this war the North has had
certain successes in the field. But how was it with England in
the revolutionary war? It was not for want of victories in the
field that England did not conquer the American colonies, for
England found when most successful in the field, the object desired
was as distant as before. It is not the question when endeavoring
to conquer a country, whether you can break up its embattled
armies and drive them off the plain, where they have contended
with you in the fight. The question is this, and this
alone, whether that country is set upon separation. If it is
bent upon separation, it is impossible to conquer it, and if the
North could conquer us, the political and civil difficulties remaining
would render that success a curse and a misery to those
who achieved it. It seems but homage to an abstract principle
that has caused England to bear the misery consequent upon
not recognising the Confederate States. There has been a sense
of the danger and mischief of interference in intestine quarrels
in other countries, and England has so far paid deference to
that principle of international policy, but it will not last a great
while longer.</p>

<p>The Yankees admit a loss of 10,000 men at Fort Donaldson—more
I believe than we had engaged in the fight.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, June 15th.</i> My cousin, S. M., called to see me to-day;
also, my friends J. C. H. and F. N. B. I was allowed fifteen
minutes conversation with each in the presence of a Federal
commissioned officer, such being the rule established here.
A sermon was preached to the prisoners to-day by the Rev. Mr.
Nourse, from Leesburg, Virginia, himself a prisoner. William
J. Mills, Company D, 12th Georgia regiment, died to-day, and
was buried at the “Congressional burying ground” in presence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
of a Confederate commissioned officer, taken there “for the purpose
of witnessing” the same. A lady friend sent me a bottle
of wine by the “Underground railroad.” I cannot say with
Hawthorne, to drink it is more a moral than a physical enjoyment,
and that like whatever else which is superlatively good, it
is better appreciated by memory than by present consciousness.
It is decidedly physical in its effects, and far better in reality
than in anticipation.</p>

<p><i>Monday, June 16th.</i> Captain L. F. Whitney, United States
cavalry, called to see me to-day. Captain W. and myself were
associated in the “draughtsman’s room,” United States Patent
office, for nearly four years—every day engaged in the same calling,
and upon terms of intimate friendship. One of his men
now stands as sentinel to the room in which I am confined.
Strange the mutations of time! Two years ago we would have
laughed at the prophecy that we would at this time be in our
present relations to each other. We talked only of the pleasures
of the past without any allusion to our present difficulties,
and the interview was, under the circumstances, short but agreeable.
An old man was brought into our room to-day, and the
officer who ushered him, remarked, as he did so, “Here is a man
that wishes to see a live rebel.” Lieutenant D. replied by informing
him that “the man with horns” was out, but would
soon be in. I presume the old fool became satisfied that we are
beings of flesh and blood, who eat, drink, sleep, and wear clothes
like other civilized people.</p>

<p>A fellow prisoner from Charlestown, Virginia, says when General
Banks was at that place he stopped at a lady’s boarding
house without giving her any compensation. He sent the lady
a few delicacies to eat while in her house, but when he went
away he presented her a bill of $5.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, June 17th.</i> The Yankee newspapers claim a victory
at Williamsburg. If that battle is a Federal triumph, they are
welcome to all such. The fact is, that they have so much at
stake, that they cannot afford to report their defeat, and do not
scruple to lie! I feel very lonesome in this close room to-day,
for those who share my captivity are reading, writing or sleeping,
and I cannot do much of either, not more than record in my
diary my present feelings. Solitude has the advantage or the
danger of making us search more deeply into the same ideas.
As our discourse is only with ourself, we always give the same
direction to the conversation; we are not called to turn it to the
subject which occupies another mind, and so an involuntary inclination
makes us return forever to knock at the same doors.
There are eight officers in this room, and we take turns in put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>ting
it in order, that is, folding up the blankets, sweeping out
the room, &amp;c., &amp;c., and some take great interest in keeping the
room clean, which is commendable. I distrust the intellect and
morality of those people to whom disorder is of no consequence—who
can live at ease in an Augean stable. What surrounds us,
reflects more or less what is within us.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, June 18th.</i> A fellow prisoner, Mr. B., the able
correspondent of the “London Times,” handed me the following
interesting article to read from the “London Morning Herald”
of April 25th. The Herald is the organ of Earl Derby:</p>

<p>“The Southern Confederacy has nearly completed its sixteenth
month of existence. In common parlance, in universal
conviction, in actual fact, in everything but formal diplomatic
recognition, the Confederate States are an independent power.
The armies that have so long ravaged their frontiers, and at last
emboldened by a great superiority of numbers, and a still greater
advantage in arms and material, have ventured on an advance
into their territory—<em>come there not as partizans in a civil war,
but as invaders</em>; they are and act as the enemies not of a faction
but of a nation—nay, of the entire population. They find
little sympathy, far less than was enjoyed by the French invaders
of Spain. They obtain no information except that very
scanty supply which the most hated enemy can always obtain
from deserters; they get no provisions except what they take by
force; they have no friends, and no power beyond their own
lines. In saying this, we except, of course, that strip of mountains
in Kentucky, Tennessee and Western Virginia, occupied
by Northern colonists, and which is part of the Confederate
States, simply by geographical position. It is very rare, as is
evident to the most ignorant and violent of Northerners, to find
a man that is within the Confederate lines who is not a devoted
adherent of the Confederate Government, and a resolute defender
of a country invaded by foreign armies. The Confederate Government
has raised in proportion to its population as large an
army as any country ever yet mustered; it could have a still
larger force if it had arms to put into their hands. It has sustained
several great battles, won several brilliant victories, and
rallied without difficulty or discouragement after one or two
severe defeats. There is no division among the people; no
Unionist faction; there is no voice raised in favor of surrender.
As the United States and the Confederate States form two
separate and hostile nations, so the Confederate Government is
clearly as independent of that of the Union as the Crown of
Denmark of the Germanic Confederation, and is as completely
organized and absolute within its own dominions as that which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
is waging war against it. It is no question now of “Secession”
or Rebellion, but of a war between two distinct powers, <em>unequal
in numbers</em>, but perfectly equal in <em>strength and status</em>, equally
sovereign and equally national. One may wrest territory from the
other, may plunder its lands, burn its towns, and blockade its
ports by virtue of superior naval and military force; but the relation
in which they stand to each other is not rebel and tyrant, not
subject and sovereign, but that of wholly separate and independent
belligerent nations. The Northern armies in Virginia or Tennessee
are as the French in Spain, or Russia in Turkey—the soldiery
of a foreign government engaged in the invasion of a soil to
which they have no other claim than may be established by the
strong hand, or bestowed by the fortunes of war. The conquest
of one nation by another, rarely as it has occurred, is not wholly
unknown or impossible. Poland is a conquered country, but for
western intervention Turkey might have been. But the conquest
of a country as large as half of Europe, which brings three or four
hundred thousand of her sons to her defence, which is <em>fortified
by primeval forests and impenetrable swamps</em>, and impregnable
by sheer extent of uninhabitable surface, is one of the wildest
schemes ever proposed by the wickedness of demagogues, or entertained
by the madness of conceit. A Napoleon with a half million
of soldiers would recoil from the task. Is a Lincoln with a
half a million of disorderly ruffians to achieve it? The subjugation
of the South is impossible, provided only the citizens of the
Confederate States display in defence of their hearths and homes,
of their rights and their country, the valor and the resolution
which have always characterized the race from which they sprang.
They are a superior race, and the children of cavaliers, and can
never yield to such an enemy. They have shown as yet no signs
of wavering or discouragement, and they have only to be resolute
in endurance, as they have shown themselves courageous in action,
to be sure of a final victory. We see in the surrender of
Island No. 10, in the doubtful operations in Virginia, in the battle
near Pittsburgh, no signs whatever of any approach to the termination
of the war in that way in which the North proposes to terminate
it, viz: by the total prostration of the Southern States, the
dissolution of the Confederacy, and the reconstruction of the
Union. The Northern Government must be aware of the futility
of its promises, the utter impracticability of its professed designs;
but the ignorant and fanatical North believe absolutely and passionately
in their own omnipotence, and its rulers are not the men
to undertake the unpopular, difficult and dangerous task of bringing
the people to a more modest frame of mind. Nothing but a
severe lesson, either a crushing defeat, or a long, expensive, result-less
and disastrous war will enlighten a people whose virtues or
Weakness alike make them obstinate and unreasonable in such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
contest as the present. If left to themselves, <i>i. e.</i>, without foreign
intervention, they will probably prolong the war into another
year. One thing at least appears certain, that the summer
must stay for some months, even under the most favorable
circumstances, the onward march of the Federal armies. If
they are able then to hold their actual positions—if they retain
possession of the greater part of Tennessee, Kentucky, and
Northern and Western Virginia—they will remain encamped on
Southern soil, wasting the crops, burning the houses, taking
property of the unhappy citizens of those rich States, but
making no progress whatever. Their vessels may continue to
keep up a nominal blockade of the Southern coast, and a real
embargo on the cotton supply, which affords bread to South Lancastershire,
England. In the meantime the Confederates will be
daily gaining strength, recruiting their forces, and receiving supplies
of arms and ammunition, the want of which has done
more to thwart their heroic efforts than either the valor or
bravery of Northern troops or skill of Northern commanders.
On the return of cold weather their position will be better, and
the termination of the war still more remote. In the interval
they cannot invade the South, and cannot hope to hang the Confederate
leaders, but they will still be starving English operatives,
unless England and France grow weary of seeing their
subjects made the victims of the war, and insist on terminating
a struggle, which, while it cannot lead to the result desired by
the aggressors, inflicts on neutrals losses almost as great as the
immediate objects of the aggression.”</p>

<p>A fellow prisoner showed me a beautiful love-letter he received
from his affianced this morning by the “Underground
railroad.” The object of his affections is not permitted to visit
him, because she has been herself a prisoner on account of her
“Secession” convictions, but she brings a letter from Alexandria
nearly every day, and sends to the “handsome Lieutenant:”</p>

<p><i>Thursday, June 19th.</i> The only event of interest to me to-day
has been the visit of an attached lady friend, Miss E. A.,
who brought me some necessary articles of clothing, quite acceptable
under the circumstances, but more appreciated on account
of the motive which prompted the mission. This lady
has two brothers in the 17th regiment of Virginia volunteers.
As an old friend, our interview of fifteen minutes afforded me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
much pleasure; but the Yankee officer present seemed desirous
to institute an espionage, more to annoy than to discharge his
orders, and which caused me to wish him in a climate where we
are told that the heat is intolerable—at all events during my
short interview with this to me beautiful angel of mercy. In
this despotic government I have noticed the ladies as well as the
sterner sex fear to express a sentiment against the tyranny of
him whom they call a Republican President. On the contrary
all must praise Abraham Lincoln, or be considered a traitor!
Great God, it seems as if they wish to honor themselves through
their master; they elevate him on their shoulders as a pedestal;
they surround him with a halo of light, in order that some of it
may be reflected on themselves. It is still the fable of the dog,
who contents himself with the chain and collar, so that they are
of gold.</p>

<p><i>June 20th.</i> I received some excellent smoking tobacco and
cigars this morning, a present from a lady in Prince George
county, Maryland. God bless the ladies!</p>

<p>The “New York Times” of yesterday contains the following
in reference to my friend Captain Monaghan, of the sixth Louisiana
regiment, who was paroled in the city during the first three
or four days after he arrived here:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center small">(COPY OF PARAGRAPH.)</p>

<p class="center">“THE LOUISIANA TIGER.”</p>

<p>“Captain Manahan, of the Louisiana Tigers, who has been
lionizing at Willard’s hotel for several days, has been sent to the
old capitol prison by order of Secretary Stanton. A gentleman,
formerly of New Orleans, and well acquainted with the Captain,
states that he does not wish to be exchanged, and is loyal to the
“Stars and Stripes.””</p></blockquote>

<p>The Captain being anxious to correct a statement so devoid of
truth, and which impeached his loyalty to the South, wrote to
the editor of the “New York Times,” but as the sequel shows
he was not permitted to send the letter, and thus the ignorant
of the North were led to believe this lie, as they have thousands
of others circulated in the same way, and without the shadow of
foundation in truth:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right">
“<span class="smcap">Old Capitol Prison, Washington, D.C., June 20, 1862.</span></p>

<p><i>To the Editor of the New York Times</i>,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: A paragraph appeared in your edition of yesterday, headed “the Louisiana
Tiger,” and I infer that the informer, who furnished matter for this paragraph,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
must have been made the dupe of a joker. I am no tiger, but the Captain of Company
F, sixth regiment Louisiana volunteers. I have been on parole some days,
anxiously awaiting an exchange. “Lionizing” is no amusement to me, but a great
bore. My convictions, as well as my heart, are with my brethren, who are fighting
in defence of my invaded country. I would that my strong right arm were there
also. I trust this will be a sufficient answer to the New Orleans gentleman, who
has <em>dared</em> to cast a stigma upon my loyalty and <em>devotion</em> to the <em>South</em>; and if further
proof of the fact were necessary, it may be discovered in the act of Mr. Secretary
Stanton, who has ordered me to be incarcerated in this place.</p>

<p>This letter was sent to the Provost Marshal for approval, but
was returned with the following note from Mr. William P.
Wood, the superintendent of the prison:</p>

<p><i>Saturday, June 21st.</i> P. C. H. called to see me to-day. He

his name.</p>

<p><i>June 22d.</i> The Rev. Father Boyle, (Catholic Priest,) called
to see me to-day. He was allowed to come into my room alone,
upon a promise not to talk about war matters. He brought me
a copy of the “National Intelligencer” of June 12th, from
which I extract the following:</p>


<p class="center">“COTTON BURNING.”</p>

<p>The London Star of May 27th thus appreciates the Confederate
policy of cotton burning:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>“If it be true that thousands of bales of goods—incapable of being converted
into munitions of war, and absolutely secure, as private properly, from confiscation
by the Federals—are being burnt or rolled into the river, the Confederates are
committing social as well as political suicide. It is an act that has no comparison
in modern history. It is not, like the destruction of Moscow, an act of desperate
patriotism, for it impoverishes the vanquished, without in the least injuring the victors.
If all the cotton, tobacco and sugar between Richmond and Mobile were
given to the flames, it would not retard by an hour the fall of those cities, nor enhance
by a dollar the cost of the conquest. Neither can it be supposed, except
by men whose offences and disasters have phrenzied their intellects, that these huge
incendiarisms will attract the slightest favor to their cause from across the Atlantic.
They must be mad, indeed, to reckon that England and France will come to
the help of men who are wantonly injuring themselves and the subjects of those
powers. The only kindness that Europe can show them, is to advise that they abstain
from such barbarous outrages, and make their peace as quickly as they can
with the government that is as superior in right as in strength, having both the
right and the power to retaliate upon such atrocities by a splendid act of mercy to
mankind.”</p>


<p class="center">ANOTHER BATTLE WITH JACKSON’S ARMY.</p>

<p>Advices received at the War Department state that Jackson’s army attacked
General Shields’s advance on Monday morning, near Port Republic. The conflict
is said to have been maintained for about four hours by about two thousand of
our men against the main body of Jackson’s army. The enemy’s force became so
overwhelming in number that our advance was compelled to fall back, which it did
in good order, until it met the main body of General Shields’s Command, near Conrad’s
store. As soon as this was effected, the enemy in turn retired. The fighting
is said to have been very severe, and the loss heavy on both sides. No further particulars
have reached the department.</p>


<p class="center">AN ACCOUNT OF THE BATTLE.</p>

<p class="psig">
<span class="smcap">Luray, Va., June 10, 1862.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Colonel Carroll, commanding the fourth brigade, consisting of the eighty-fourth
Pennsylvania, the eleventh Pennsylvania, the seventh Indiana, and the first Virginia
regiments, altogether about sixteen hundred strong, reached Port Republic
on Sunday, and reconnoitered and found the enemy in the town. They had a skirmish,
and concluded to hold the bridge. They ordered it not to be burned, and
put guns in position commanding it.</p>

<p>At six o’clock on Monday this battery was opened upon by some twenty heavy
guns, which were placed in position during the night. Our forces tried to reach
the bridge repeatedly to destroy it, but were met by storms of bullets, and had to
retire. A large cavalry force crossed and attacked our troops, while their infantry
followed our men, opposing them at every step, after driving them back with heavy
loss; but our numbers, after General Tyler’s third brigade arrived, were so much
inferior to the enemy—theirs being at least five to one—that our position became
so untenable, that it was impossible to hold it. We were therefore compelled to
fall back, our boys fighting every foot of the way. After falling back some three
or four miles, a body of cavalry were sent to attack us, but were received in such
a manner as to compel them to retire, after which the engagement ended, having
lasted about five hours.</p>

<p>Our loss in killed and wounded is not known, but it is large, as is also that of the
enemy. We lost a large number of prisoners.</p>

<p>Colonel Carroll’s horse fell, injuring the Colonel badly, and Captain Kelly, of
General Shields’s staff, was also much injured in the head. He received praise
from all who witnessed his conduct in the action.</p>

<p>Colonel Buckley, of the 29th Ohio, was badly wounded. His men charged three
times to obtain possession of his body, but it was carried off by the enemy.</p>

<p>General Ashby, of cavalry notoriety, was positively killed during the fight at the
bridge over Middle river. Captain Keogh charged with a body of cavalry, and
held the bridge some time during a terrible storm of grape.</p>

<p>This was one of the most hotly contested engagements of the whole war, as is
indicated by the loss compared with the numbers engaged, who fought like demons.</p>

<p>Two regiments from the first brigade arrived in time to assist in covering the
retreat. The pioneer corps also assisted. Colonel Buckley has arrived here
wounded.</p></blockquote>

<p class="center">THE RETREAT OF GENERAL BANKS—HIS OFFICIAL REPORT.</p>

<p><i>Report of the march of the first division fifth corps d’armie from Strasburg, Virginia, to
Williamsport, Maryland, on the 24th and 25th days of May, 1862.</i></p>

<p class="psig">
<span class="smcap">Headquarters Army Shenandoah.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon. E. M. Stanton</span>, <i>Secretary of War</i>.
</p>

<p>Information was received on the evening of May 23d, that the enemy, in very
large force, had descended on the guard at Front Royal, Colonel Kenly, first Maryland
regiment, commanding, burning the bridges and driving our troops toward
Strasburg with great loss. Owing to what was deemed an extravagant statement
of the enemy’s strength, these reports were received with some distrust; but a regiment
of infantry, with a strong detachment of cavalry and a section of artillery,
were immediately sent to reinforce Colonel Kenly. Later in the evening despatches
from fugitives who had escaped to Winchester informed us that Colonel Kenly’s
force had been destroyed, with but few exceptions, and the enemy, 15,000 or 20,000
strong, were advancing by rapid marches on Winchester.</p>

<p>Orders were immediately given to halt the reinforcements sent to Front Royal,
which had moved by different routes, and detachments of troops, under experienced
officers, were sent in every direction to explore the roads leading from
Front Royal to Strasburg, Middletown, Newtown and Winchester, to ascertain the
force, position and purpose of this sudden movement of the enemy. It was soon
found that his pickets were in possession of every road, and rumors from every
quarter represented him in movement, in the rear of his pickets, in the direction of
our camp.</p>

<p>The extraordinary force of the enemy could no longer be doubted. It was apparent,
also, that they had a more extended purpose than the capture of the brave
little band at Front Royal.</p>

<p>This purpose could be nothing less than the defeat of my own command, or its
possible capture by occupying Winchester, and by this movement intercepting supplies
or reinforcements, and cutting off all possibility of retreat.</p>

<p>It was also apparent, from the reports of fugitives, prisoners, Union men, and
our own reconnoitering parties, that the three divisions of the enemy’s troops,
known to be in the valley, and embracing at least 25,000 men, were united and
close upon us, in some enterprise not yet developed.</p>

<p>The suggestion, that had their object been a surprise, they would not have given
notice of their approach by an attack on Front Royal, was answered by the fact,
that on the only remaining point of attack—the Staunton road—our outposts were
five miles in advance, and daily reconnaissances made for a distance of twelve
hides towards Woodstock.</p>

<p>Under this interposition of the enemy’s plans, our position demanded instant decision
and action. Three courses were open to us: First, a retreat across Little
North Mountain to the Potomac river, on the west. Second, an attack upon the
enemy’s flank on the Front Royal road. Third, a rapid movement direct upon
Winchester, with a view to anticipate his occupation of the town by seizing it ourselves,
thus placing my command in communication with its original base of operations,
in the line of reinforcements by Harper’s Ferry and Martinsburg, and securing
a safe retreat in case of disaster.</p>

<p>To remain at Strasburg was to be surrounded; to move over the mountains was
to abandon our train at the outset, and to subject my command to flank attacks,
without possibility of succor; and to attack the enemy in such overwhelming force
could only result in certain destruction. It was, therefore, determined to enter
the lists with the enemy in a race or a battle, as he should choose, for the possession
of Winchester, the key of the valley, and for us the position of safety.</p>


<p class="center">THE MARCH.</p>

<p>At three o’clock, A.M., the 24th instant, the reinforcements, infantry, artillery
and cavalry, sent to Colonel Kenly, were recalled; the advance guard, Colonel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
Donnelly’s brigade, were ordered to return to Strasburg. Several hundred disabled
men, left in our charge by Shields’ division, were put upon the march, and
our wagon train ordered forward to Winchester under escort of cavalry and infantry.
General Hatch, with nearly our whole force of cavalry, and six pieces of artillery,
was charged with the protection of the rear of the column, and the destruction
of army stores, for which transportation was not provided, with instructions to
remain in front of the town as long as possible, and hold the enemy in check, our
expectations of attack being in that direction. All these orders were executed
with incredible alacrity, and soon after nine o’clock the column was on the march,
Colonel Donnelly in front, Colonel Gordon in the centre, and General Hatch in the
rear.</p>

<p>The column had passed Cedar creek, about three miles from Strasburg, with the
exception of the rear guard, still in front of Strasburg, when information was received
from the front that the enemy had attacked the train, and was in full possession
of the road at Middletown. This report was confirmed by the return of
fugitives, refugees and wagons, which came tumbling to the rear in fearful confusion.</p>

<p>It being apparent now that our immediate danger was in front, the troops were
ordered to the head of the column, and the train to the rear, and, in view of a possible
necessity of our return to Strasburg, Captain James W. Albert, Topographical
corps, who associated with him the Zouaves D’Afrique, Captain Collis, was ordered
to prepare Cedar creek bridge for the flames, in order to prevent a pursuit
in that direction by the enemy. In the execution of this order Captain Albert and
the Zouaves were cut off from the column, which they joined at Williamsport.
They had at Strasburg a sharp conflict with the enemy, in which his cavalry suffered
severely. An interesting report of this affair will be found in the reports of
Captain Albert and Captain Collis.</p>


<p class="center">THE FIRST CONFLICT.</p>

<p>The head of the reorganized column, Colonel Donnelly commanding, encountered
the enemy in force at Middletown, about thirteen miles from Winchester. Three
hundred troops had been seen in town, but it soon appeared that larger forces were
in the rear. The brigade halted, and the forty-sixth Pennsylvania, Colonel Knipe,
was ordered to penetrate the woods on the right and dislodge the enemy’s skirmishers.
They were supported by a section of Cochran’s New York battery. Five
companies of the enemy’s cavalry were discovered in an open field in the rear of the
woods, and our artillery, masked at first by the infantry, opened fire upon them.
They stood fire for a while, but at length retreated, pursued by our skirmishers.
The twenty eighth New York, Lieutenant Colonel Brown, was now brought up, and
under a heavy fire of infantry and artillery the enemy were driven back more than
two miles from the pike. Colonel Donnelly being informed at that point by a citizen,
in great alarm, that four thousand men were in the woods beyond, the men were
anxious to continue the fight; but as this would have defeated our object by the
loss of valuable time, with the exception of a small guard, they were ordered to
resume the march.</p>

<p>This affair occurred under my own observation, and I have great pleasure in
vouching for the admirable conduct of officers and men. We lost one man killed
and some wounded. The loss of the enemy could not be ascertained.</p>

<p>This episode, with the change of front, occupied nearly an hour, but it saved our
column. Had the enemy vigorously attacked our train while at the head of the
column, it would have been thrown into such dire confusion as to have made a
successful continuation of our march impossible. Pending this contest, Colonel
Broadhead, of the first Michigan cavalry, was ordered to advance, and, if possible,
to cut his way through and occupy Winchester. It was the report of this energetic
officer that gave us the first assurance that our course was yet clear, and he was
the first of our column to enter the town.</p>


<p class="center">THE SECOND COMBAT.</p>

<p>When it was first reported that the enemy had pushed between us and Winches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>ter,
General Hatch was ordered to advance with all his available cavalry from
Strasburg, leaving Colonel De Forrest to cover the rear, and destroy stores not provided
with transportation. Major Vought, fifth New York cavalry, had been previously
ordered to reconnoitre the Front Royal road to ascertain the position of
the enemy, whom he encountered in force near Middletown, and was compelled to
fall back, immediately followed by the enemy’s cavalry, infantry and artillery. In
this affair five of our men were killed and several wounded. The enemy’s loss is
not known.</p>

<p>After repeated attempts to force a passage through the lines of the enemy, now
advanced to the pike, General Hatch, satisfied that this result could not be accomplished
without great loss, and supposing our army to have proceeded but a short
distance, turned to the left, and moving upon a parallel road, made several ineffectual
attempts to effect a junction with the main column. At Newtown, however,
he found Colonel Gordon holding the enemy in check, and joined his brigade. Major
Collins, with three companies of cavalry, mistaking the point where the main
body of the cavalry left the road, dashed upon the enemy until stopped by a barricade
of wagons, and the tempestuous fire of infantry and artillery. His loss
must have been severe.</p>

<p>Six companies of the fifth New York, Colonel De Forrest, and six companies of
the first Vermont cavalry, Colonel Tompkins, after repeated and desperate efforts to
effect a junction with the main body—the road now being filled with infantry, artillery
and cavalry—fell back to Strasburg, where they found the Zouaves
D’Afrique. The fifth New York, failing to effect a junction at Winchester, and also
at Martinsburg, came in at Clear Spring, with a train of thirty two wagons and
many stragglers. The first Vermont, Colonel Tompkins, joined us at Winchester,
with six pieces of artillery, and participated in the fight of the next morning.
Nothing could surpass the celerity and spirit with which the various companies of
cavalry executed their movements or their intrepid charges upon the enemy.</p>

<p>General Hatch deserves great credit for the manner in which he discharged his
duties as chief of cavalry in this part of our march, as well as at the fight at Winchester,
and in covering the rear of our column to the river; but especially for the
spirit infused into his troops during the brief period of his command, which, by
confession of friend and foe, had been equal if not superior to the best of the enemy’s
long trained mounted troops.</p>

<p>From this point the protection of the rear of the column devolved upon the
forces under Colonel Gordon.</p>

<p class="center">THE THIRD COMBAT.</p>

<p>The guard having been separated from the column, and the rear of the train having
been attacked by an increased force near the bridge between Newtown and
Kearnstown, Colonel Gordon was directed to send back the second Massachusetts,
Lieutenant Colonel Brown to rescue the rear of the train and hold the enemy in
check. They found him at Newtown, with a strong force of infantry, cavalry and
artillery.</p>

<p>The second Massachusetts was employed in the field, supported by the twenty-eighth
New York and twenty-seventh Indiana, and ordered to drive the enemy
from the town, and the battery was at the same time so placed as to silence the
guns of the enemy.</p>

<p>Both these objects were quickly accomplished. They found it impossible to
reach Middletown, so as to enable the cavalry under General Hatch to join the
column, or to cover entirely the rear of the train. Large bodies of the enemy’s
cavalry passed upon our right and left, and the increased vigor of his movements
demonstrated the rapid advance of the main body. A cavalry charge made upon
our troops was received in squares on the right and on the road, and in the line of
the left, which repelled his assault, and gained time to reform the train, to cover
its rear, and to burn the disabled wagons. This affair occupied several hours—the
regiments having been moved to the rear about six o’clock, and not reaching the
town until after twelve.</p>

<p>A full report by Colonel Gordon, who commanded in person, is enclosed herewith.
The principal loss of the second Massachusetts occurred in this action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span></p>

<p class="center">THE FIGHT AT WINCHESTER.</p>

<p>The strength and purpose of the enemy were to us unknown when we reached
Winchester, except upon surmise and vague rumors from Front Royal. These
rumors were strengthened by the vigor with which the enemy had pressed our
main column, and defeated at every point efforts of detachments to effect a junction
with the main column.</p>

<p>At Winchester, however, all suspicion was relieved on that subject, all classes—Secessionists,
Unionists, Refugees and Prisoners—agreed that the enemy’s force at
or near Winchester was overwhelming, ranging from 25,000 to 30,000. Rebel officers,
who came into our camp with entire unconcern, supposing that their own
troops occupied the town, as a matter of course, and were captured, confirmed
these statements, and added that an attack would be made on us at daybreak. I
determined to test the substance and strength of the enemy by actual collision, and
measures were promptly taken to prepare our troops to meet them. They had
taken up their positions on entering the town after dark, without expectation of a
battle, and were at disadvantage, as compared with the enemy.</p>

<p>The rolling of musketry was heard during the latter part of the night, and before
the break of day a sharp engagement occurred at the outposts. Soon after
four o’clock the artillery opened its fire, which continued without cessation till the
close of the engagement.</p>

<p>The right of our line was occupied by the third brigade, Colonel George H. Gordon
commanding. The regiments were strongly posted, and near the centre covered
by stone walls from the fire of the enemy.</p>

<p>Their infantry opened on the right, and soon both lines were under heavy fire.</p>

<p>The left was occupied by the third brigade, Colonel Dudley Donnelly commanding.</p>

<p>The line was weak, compared with that of the enemy, but the troops were posted,
and patiently awaited, as they nobly improved their coming opportunity. The
earliest movements of the enemy were on our left, two regiments being sent to
move, as with the purpose of occupying a position in flank or rear. General Hatch
sent a detachment of cavalry to intercept this movement, when it was apparently
abandoned. The enemy suffered very serious loss from the fire of our infantry on
the left. One regiment is represented by persons present during the action and
after the field was evacuated as nearly destroyed.</p>

<p>The main body of the enemy was hidden during the early part of the action by
the crest of the hill and the woods in the rear.</p>

<p>Their force was massed apparently upon our right, and their manœuvres indicated
a purpose to turn us upon the Berryville road, where it appeared subsequently
they had placed a considerable force, with a view of preventing reinforcements from
Harper’s Ferry. But the steady fire of our lines held them in check, until a small
portion of the troops, on the right of our line, made a movement to the rear. It
is but just to add that this was done under the erroneous impression that an order
to withdraw had been given. No sooner was this observed by the enemy, than its
regiments swarmed upon the crest of the hill, advancing from the woods upon our
right, which, still continuing its fire steadily, withdrew towards the town.</p>

<p>The overwhelming force of the enemy, now suddenly showing itself, making further
resistance unwise, orders were sent to the left by Captain De Hauteville to
withdraw, which was done reluctantly, but in order, the enemy having greatly suffered
in the wing. A portion of the troops passed through the town in some confusion,
but the column was soon reformed, and continued its march in order. This
engagement held the enemy in check five hours.</p>

<p>The forces engaged were greatly unequal. Indisposed to accept the early rumors
concerning the enemy’s strength, I reported to the department that it was
about 15,000. It is now conclusively shown that not less than 25,000 men were in
position, and could have been brought into action. On the right and left their
great superiority of numbers was plainly felt and seen, and the signal officers, from
elevated positions, were enabled to count regimental standards, indicating a strength
equal to that above stated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span></p>

<p>My own command consisted of two brigades of less than four thousand men,
all told, with nine hundred cavalry, ten Parrott guns, and one battery of six-pounders,
smooth bore cannon. To this should be added the tenth Maine regiment of infantry,
and five companies of Maryland cavalry, stationed at Winchester, which
were engaged in the action. The loss of the enemy was treble that of ours in
killed and wounded. In prisoners ours greatly exceeded theirs.</p>

<p>Officers, whose word I cannot doubt, have stated, as the result of their own observation,
that our men were fired upon from private dwellings in passing through
Winchester; but I am credibly informed, and gladly believe, that the atrocities
said to have been perpetrated upon our wounded soldiers by the rebels are greatly
exaggerated, or entirely untrue.</p>

<p>Our march was turned in the direction of Martinsburg, hoping there to meet with
reinforcements—the troops moving in three parallel columns, each protected by an
efficient rear guard. Pursuit by the enemy was prompt and vigorous, but our
movements were rapid, and without loss.</p>

<p>A few miles from Winchester the sound of a steam whistle, heard in the direction
of Martinsburg, strengthened the hope of reinforcements, and stirred the blood
of the men like a trumpet. Soon after two squadrons of cavalry came dashing
down the road with wild hurrahs. They were thought to be the advance of the
anticipated support, and were received with deafening cheers. Every man felt like
turning back upon the enemy. It proved to be the first Maryland cavalry, Lieutenant
Colonel Metschky, sent out in the morning as a train guard. Hearing the
guns, they had returned to participate in the fight.</p>

<p>Advantage was taken of this stirring incident to reorganize our column, and the
march was continued with renewed spirit and order. At Martinsburg the column
halted two and a half hours, the rear guard remaining until seven in the evening in
rear of the town, and arrived at the river at sundown, forty-eight hours after the
first news of the attack on Front Royal. It was a march of fifty-three miles,
thirty-five of which were performed in one day. The scene at the river when the
rear guard arrived was of the most animating and exciting description. A thousand
camp fires were burning on the hill side; a thousand carriages of every description
were crowded upon the banks of the broad river between the exhausted
troops and their coveted rest.</p>

<p>The ford was too deep for the teams to cross in regular succession; only the
strongest horses, after a few experiments, were allowed to essay the passage of the
river before morning. The single ferry was occupied by the ammunition trains,
the ford by the wagons. The cavalry was secure in its form of crossing. The
troops only had no transportation. Fortunately the train we had so sedulously
guarded served us in turn. Several boats belonging to the pontoon train, which
we had brought from Strasburg, were launched, and devoted exclusively to their
service. It is seldom that a river crossing of such magnitude is achieved with
greater success. There never were more grateful hearts in the same number of
men then when at midday on the 20th we stood on the opposite shore.</p>

<p>My command had not suffered an attack and rout, but accomplished a premeditated
march of nearly sixty miles in the face of the enemy, defeating his plans
and giving him battle wherever he was found.</p>

<p>Our loss is stated in detail, with the names of the killed, wounded and missing,
in the full report of Brigadier General A. S. Williams, commanding division, to
which reference is made. The whole number in killed is 38, wounded 155, missing
711. Total loss 905.</p>

<p>It is undoubtedly true that many of the missing will yet return, and the entire
loss may be assumed as not exceeding seven hundred. It is also probable that the
number of killed and wounded may be larger than that above stated, but the
aggregate loss will not be changed thereby. All our guns were saved.</p>

<p>Our wagon train consisted of nearly five hundred wagons. Of this number fifty-five
were lost. They were not, with a few exceptions, abandoned to the enemy, but
were burned upon the road. Nearly all of our supplies were thus saved. The
stores at Front Royal, of which I had no knowledge until my visit to that position
on the 21st instant, and those at Winchester, of which a considerable portion was
destroyed by our troops, are not embraced in this statement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span></p>

<p>The number of sick men in the hospital at Strasburg, belonging to General Williams’s
division, was 189, 125 of whom were left in the hospital at Winchester,
under charge of surgeon Lincoln R. Stone, second Massachusetts, or were left in
hospital at Strasburg, including attendants, under charge of surgeon Gillespie,
seventh Indiana, and assistant surgeon Porter, United States army.</p>

<p>Eight of the surgeons of this division voluntarily surrendered themselves to the
enemy, in the hospitals and on the field, for the care of the sick and wounded
placed under their charge. They include, in addition to those above named,
brigade surgeon Peale, at Winchester; surgeon Mitchell, first Maryland, at Front
Royal; surgeon Adolphus, Bests’s battery, United States army; surgeon Johnson,
sixteenth Indiana; and surgeon Francis Leland, second Massachusetts, on the
field.</p>

<p>It is seldom that men are called upon to make a greater sacrifice of comfort,
health and liberty, for the benefit of those entrusted to their charge. Services
and sacrifices like these ought to entitle them to some more important recognition
of their devotion to public duty than the mere historical record of the fact.</p>

<p>The report of the medical director, surgeon W. S. King, exhibits the disposition
of nearly one thousand sick and disabled men left at Strasburg by Shields’s division
upon its removal to the Rappahannock valley.</p>

<p>My warmest thanks are due to the officers and men of my command for their
unflinching courage and unyielding spirit exhibited on the march and its attendant
combats. Especially to Brigadier General A. S. Williams, commanding the division,
General George S. Greene, and General L. W. Crawford, who had reported for
duty, but were yet unassigned to separate commands. They accompanied the column
throughout the march, and rendered me most valuable assistance.</p>

<p>My thanks are also due to the gentlemen of my staff—Major D. D. Perkins,
chief of staff; Captain James W. Albert, of the Topographical Engineers; Captain
Wm. Sheffler, Captain Frederick Munther, and Captain Frederick De Hauteville—for
their arduous labors.</p>

<p>It gives me pleasure also to commend the conduct of Colonel Donnelly and Colonel
Gordon, commanding the two brigades. I would also respectfully ask the
attention of the department to the reports of the several officers commanding
detachments separate from the main column, and to the officers named in the report
of General Williams, as worthy of commendation for meritorious conduct.</p>

<p>The signal corps, Lieutenant W. W. Rowley commanding, rendered most valuable
service on the field and in the march. There should be some provision for
the prompt promotion of officers and men so brave and useful as those composing
this corps. The safety of the train and supplies is, in a great degree, due to the
discretion, experience, and unfailing energy of Captain S. B. Holabird and Captain
E. G. Beckwith, United States army.</p>

traitor and unscrupulous scoundrel, “Parson Brownlow,” to the
“Philadelphia Enquirer:”</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><i>Extracts from Northern papers.</i></p>

<p class="center">EAST TENNESSEE.</p>

<p>
<i>Editor Philadelphia Inquirer:</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>—I have two letters of recent date, and from reliable sources, giving me
news from East Tennessee, which I desire to place you in possession of, and
through you the public generally.</p>

<p>The persecutions of the Union men continue, and really increase in severity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
The property of all Union men in the Federal States and army was being sold at
auction, including furniture, stock, grain, agricultural implements, &amp;c., no attention
being paid to the necessities of their families. The Union citizens and soldiers,
who are in the prisons of Salisbury, Tuscaloosa and Mobile, are dying
rapidly from the effects of tainted meat, rotten food, and starvation. The Rebel
authorities seek to dispose of Union men in this way.</p>

<p>The whole country in East Tennessee is filled with guerrilla bands, who are
committing all sorts of depredations on Union people, and destroying their property.
The Union men in the United States army, at Cumberland Gap, are breathing
threatening and slaughter against the despoilers of their homes, the consumers
of their substance, and the murderers of their parents and relatives, and nothing
but the direct interference of Providence will prevent them from executing their
threats. No military discipline will be sufficiently strong to prevent these men
from the indiscriminate slaughter of those Secession leaders and soldiers who have
done all this mischief.</p>

<p>One of the letters before me is from a Union officer at Cumberland Gap, and is
dated June 27th. It gives this information: “Duncan McCall is just over from
Knox county, and reports eight thousand Rebel troops at Knoxville, who were
going to Atlanta, Georgia, by way of Maryville, distant only sixteen miles from
Knoxville. The Secesh citizens had their goods packed up and marked for Atlanta,
and were themselves crossing the river at Knoxville. The Rebels had
arrested Montgomery Thomburg, Lemuel Johnson, Esquire Galbraith, Oliver p.
Temple, John Baxter and others, and sent them to Tuscaloosa. Thomburg and
Temple were dead, and the remains of the former had been brought back. Others
were lying at the point of death.”</p>

<p>Colonel Thomburg was the commonwealth’s attorney, and visited my bedside the
night before I was started out of the bogus Confederacy, upon a pass granted him
by the commanding officer. When he took leave of me he held me by the hand,
and with tears in his eyes, made this remark: “Brownlow, I am glad you are
going out, and I hope you may arrive safe; but God only knows what will become
of those of us who remain!”</p>

<p>Colonel Temple was a good lawyer, in comfortable circumstances, and as noble a
man as lived in Tennessee. He was a Bell Everett elector for that district in the
late election for President. He leaves a wife and one child to mourn his loss. He
had been my friend through evil and good report.</p>

<p>Colonel Baxter is a wealthy lawyer, of fine talents, and a citizen of Knoxville.
He has been my friend for years, and I sympathize with his wife and ten interesting
children. Certainly nothing short of an old fashioned orthodox <em>hell</em> will suit
as a place of confinement for the persecutors of these Union men.</p>

<p class="center">THE CONFEDERATE GENERAL JACKSON.</p>

<p>General Jackson was educated at West Point, and was afterwards a professor for
fifteen years at the Virginia Military School at Lexington. He is a cousin of the
Jackson who was once Lieutenant Governor of Virginia, and of the Jackson who
is now the United States District Judge for Western Virginia. The family settled
early in that region, and furnished its representative in Congress for about thirty
years, commencing with the administration of General Washington. It has become
a numerous family in the Valley of Virginia and in Western Virginia, and its members
are about equally divided by the present struggle. After his hard fight of
last Sunday with General Fremont, in which he was compelled to leave the field,
he attacked the next day and drove back an advanced force of two thousand men
of the army of General Shields. Such persistency proves that he has the confidence
of his troops, and he doubtless deserves it. He has been the fighting hero
of the war on the Confederate side.—<cite>Washington Republican.</cite></p>


<p class="center">THE REVEALING OF THE GRAVES AT CORINTH.</p>

<p>Suspicions of the contents of some of the graves found in the vicinity of Co<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>rinth,
caused an investigation and exhuming of the deposits. Neatly made graves,
with necessary head and foot boards, bearing the names of colonels and majors
were visited, and the loose earth covering them was ordered to be removed, when,
on arriving to the depth of four feet, a solid substance was struck, which upon
clearing the earth around, was found to be contraband Secesh, in the shape of
siege guns. One grave with the head-board designated as “Colonel somebody,”
was found to contain a 64 pounder siege gun. “Quite a heavy colonel that.”
Others were found, but in what number I have not learned. Some have been found
buried in the swamps beyond Corinth.—<cite>Correspondent Cincinnati Times.</cite></p>


<p class="center">THE BLACKEST PAGE.</p>

<p>When the truthful historian shall write the history of this sad and unholy civil
war, there will be in the volume many pages over which a shadow of blackness will
forever rest; but the blackest page will be that which hands down to future generations
the record of General Butler’s order in regard to the women of New Orleans.
Like the shadow of a great wrong, it will forever darken the fair brow of
the Goddess of Liberty. The millions yet unborn will read it with commingled
feelings of shame and pity, and doubt our boasted claim to freedom, civilization
and Christianity. True, it is but the act of one man, but that man commissioned
and paid by his country for the enforcement of the laws and the preservation of
society. If the government retains him in commission, it becomes responsible for
his acts, and endorses his infamy.</p>

<p>No man respects more than we do the well-earned reputation of the American
army:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse indent14">“It is a school</div>
   <div class="verse">Where every principle tending to honor</div>
   <div class="verse">Is taught—<em>if followed</em>;”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>but in the name of that distinguished army we solemnly protest against an act
which would blight its greenest laurels, and lay its trophies prostrate in the dust.
If they war, let it not be done on domestic happiness; if they invade, be their
country’s hearths inviolable; let them achieve a triumph wherever their banners
fly, but be it not over morals, innocence and virtue.</p>

<p>Let the government remove this stigma from its name by removing General Butler
from his command.—<cite>Ohio Dayton Empire, June 7.</cite></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is a United States Court at Washington city which makes a business of
catching and surrendering persons claimed as fugitive slaves, and refuses to hear
evidence that the claimants are traitors. If anybody wants to be taxed for the
support of such a court, let him be so taxed; we don’t. How many judicial functionaries,
beginning with Chief Justice Roger B. Taney, are taking pay from the
United States, while their hearts are with the Southern Confederacy, we cannot
say; but we think the number ought to be reduced. Who shall devise the proper
mode?—<cite>New York Tribune.</cite></p></blockquote>

<p><i>June 25th.</i> To-day a lady from Alexandria, Virginia, called
to see a prisoner, and the latter remarked to her that he had
suffered very much since his confinement from sickness and privation,
and the lady replied, “Well, you must bear it manfully,
you are doing what you believe to be your duty,” whereupon the
Yankee Lieutenant present, whose name is Holmes, told her she
“must leave the room, or she would be arrested.” The Rev.
Mr. Nourse, heretofore permitted to preach funeral sermons over
prisoners who have died here, has been superseded on the charge
of uttering Secession sentiments. Having heard every sermon
he has preached, I can truthfully record that he has not at any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
time said anything which could be <em>tortured</em> into “Secession sentiments.”
They must have objected to the repetition by Mr.
Nourse of the commandments: “Thou shalt not steal,” or
“thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s man servant, nor his maid
servant,” &amp;c.; for no doubt their guilty consciences caused them
to feel pain upon the utterance of these imperative injunctions
from Holy Writ, and some one of them were compelled to be
present on such an occasion:</p>

<p class="center">FROM THE SHENANDOAH—HOW MATTERS STAND IN THE VALLEY.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Correspondence of the Cincinnati Times.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Winchester</span>, June 18.—At the present writing, I think it is safe, in consideration
of the time which must elapse before the publication of my letter, to state that,
though I have industriously sought for information, I have yet to find the first officer
of any military importance who has any hesitancy in stating that he considers their
condition of the most critical character. What renders it the more so at present is
the fact that the whereabouts of Jackson is not known. He may be moving on
Front Royal to attack Shields, or he may be circumventing the Strasburg Mountain
to get in the rear of Fremont. Every precaution is being used that human or
military ingenuity can invent, in the way of scouts and videttes, but the troops are
limited in number and worn out by their late duties, while the country is extensive
and well suited for the purposes of war, to a people who know the windings of
every mountain road, and whose spies are like the cattle of Ossian’s hero “on a
thousand hills.”</p>

<p>Further than this, Secessia fights its battles in the valleys, in the midst of its
friends. The farmer who refuses a particle of food to the Union traveler, although
the latter is willing to pay for it, is ever ready to turn out all he has to the Confederate
army—first, because he really sympathizes with the Confederate soldiers, and,
secondly, because he fears to withhold what he is confident they will take whether
he is willing or not.</p>


<p class="center">MORE FORCES WANTED.</p>

<p>As I have said in almost every letter I have ever written you from this quarter,
the general cry is “We want more troops in the Valley.” An application, as I
stated, has been made to Secretary Stanton, and I understand it is now to be backed
by the urgent persuasions of two other members of the Cabinet, who are convinced
of the insufficiency of the force in this section.</p>

<p>A small portion of the force here has been sent to Hagerstown, Williamsport and
Martinsburg, to guard those points, and I think the movement is a very wise one.
The 84th Ohio Regiment, one of the new Regiments, has arrived at Cumberland,
and it will probably take the place of some of those more experienced, and act as
post garrisons, while those heretofore engaged in that duty will be called to more
active service.</p>

<p>Rumors are abroad as to the expected arrival of a portion of General Halleck’s
force in this quarter, but I can see no reliable foundation for the rumor.</p>


<p class="center">FRONT ROYAL OR MOUNT JACKSON?</p>

<p>Public opinion, and by that I mean military speculation, is just now strongly divided
as to whether that arch traitor, Jackson, is still in front of Mount Jackson,
or is wending his way toward a meditated attack on General Shields, at Front
Royal. I am somewhat inclined to think it is toward the latter. As I am now
situated, I am an “intermediate circumstance” between the two points.</p>


<p class="center">WHERE WILL JACKSON STRIKE?—TROUBLE AMONG THE FEDERAL TROOPS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Middletown</span>, June 19.—Everything to-day bears the appearance of a “muss,” to
come off somewhere in this region almost immediately. Whether this will be on
the Mount Jackson road, or at Front Royal, as I stated in my former letter, it is
impossible for me yet to say, but I listen for the tidings hourly which shall announce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
the opening of the battle. Matters point most directly to Front Royal, yet with
the acuteness of General Jackson to manage Secession affairs, it may break upon
us from some of the mountain defiles either beyond that point or over on the Mount
Jackson road, or just as likely in the immediate vicinity of this place, or, again,
between here and Winchester, in our rear.</p>

<p><em>With the condition of feeling that I know to exist among both officers and men on the
National side, I have no hesitation to state that after a hotly contested field, the result of the
battle will be another grand “skedaddle.”</em> The knowledge that Jackson has been
heavily reinforced is patent to every private in our ranks, and that consequence
must ensue which attends as a certainty upon the efforts of men who fight under
discouraging circumstances. The retreat of June 2d is still fresh in their minds,
and the failure of the War Department to properly reinforce the division in the
Mountain Department, I believe, will be productive of results greatly to be deplored.
I may be mistaken in my conjectures, but I give you my impressions, and leave to
time to prove their correctness or falsity. The electric wire may have notified you
before this reaches you, relative to what I say. I repeat, something is on the eve
of being accomplished, and only a change produced by unforeseen circumstances
will prevent its accomplishment.</p>


<p class="center">ARRIVAL OF CONFEDERATE PRISONERS AT PHILADELPHIA.</p>

<p class="center"><cite>From the Philadelphia Inquirer, June 25.</cite></p>

<p>Four hundred and ninety Confederate prisoners, taken recently at various points
in the Shenandoah Valley, arrived from Harrisburg last evening, and at half past
eight reached Washington street wharf, whence they left the cars for the steamboat
Major Reybold, which transported them to Fort Delaware. Of these men four
hundred and thirty-four arrived in Harrisburg on the 16th instant, and fifty-eight
the day before yesterday, making in all four hundred and ninety-two, of whom two
still remain sick in Harrisburg. They had among them but one officer, Major
Davis, of the 2d Virginia Infantry, who had been at the battle of Bull Run, and in
all the engagements since fought in the valley, under Jackson.</p>

<p>He is a native of Jefferson county, Virginia, is very prepossessing and gentlemanly,
and about 35 years of age. His coat was of fine grey cloth, with abundant
gold lace on the arms and collar; his pantaloons were of light army blue, and his
cap of the same color. The prisoners were under charge of a guard, commanded
by Lieutenant-Colonel Thompson, of the 115th Pennsylvania Regiment, and appeared
in good spirits, taking their present and anticipated confinement with great
philosophy. Many were from Northern States, and not a few from Massachusetts.
Irishmen were by no means unfrequent among them.</p>

<p>The account given by Northern men and foreigners generally was, that they were
pressed into the service, or enlisted through want of employment and the means of
living. The whole gang were exceedingly sun-burnt and rugged through exposure
and incessant marching, and in an inconceivably filthy state, their clothing being
filled with vermin. The prisoners were in sixteen cars, of which nearly all were
freight cars. Each of these, on arrival, was surrounded by crowds who entered
into conversation with the prisoners. One Confederate was asked if he would take
the oath of allegiance, and answered, “I’ll see you —— first.”</p>

<p>Another asked if it was true that McClellan was dead. “You’ll hear about that
when he gets into Richmond,” said one of the crowd. “He’d better hurry up,
then,” was the reply. “You know he said he was going to be there on the 4th of
July, he has only nine days ahead of him.” In answer to the numerous charges
of cruelty urged against the Confederates, both towards wounded men and towards
prisoners, this was denied as regards the mass of the Confederate army, but it was
allowed that individual cases might have been perpetrated by the “Pineys,” or ignorant
backwoodsmen of the South. The prisoners claimed that the Confederates
were men, as were the Unionists, and would act towards their fellow-creatures
fully as well.</p>


<p class="center">THE REBEL ASHBY.</p>

<p class="center"><i>From our own Correspondent.</i></p>

<p class="psig">
<span class="smcap">Baltimore</span>, June 16, 1862.</p>

<p>Turner Ashby belonged to Fauquier county, where his family was influential, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
not wealthy. In Washington, Baltimore and Richmond, the Ashbys were well
known among people of superior social position, and were everywhere esteemed
for their intelligence, courage and honor. But the refinement which seems to have
been a characteristic of the same, must have met with an exception in the “Black-Horse”
Colonel, who is always described as brusque, stern, soldier-like.</p>

<p>His earliest military experience, beyond the mere soldier-playing of Virginia
horsemen, was in command of a company of cavalry, whom he led to Charlestown
immediately upon the apparition of John Brown at Harper’s Ferry. It was then
and there that Ashby’s “Black-Horse” had their name; his men were mounted on
blooded black chargers, and the chargers were mounted by “blooded” white riders—horse
and man alike were of the first families. His men were picked for their
equestrian accomplishments, and many of their horses were bred and trained on
his own plantation. As for himself, his name as a horseman is famous from Washington
to Winchester, his repute in this respect being equal to that of the gallant,
but reckless Randolph Ridgely, of Baltimore, to the exploits of whose battery in
Mexico, Colonel May is mainly indebted for his dragoon reputation.</p>

<p>During the John Brown affair, Ashby scouted the Shenandoah county for negro
conspirators, and effectually checked the spirit of servile uprising. He was one of
the first to enlist in the Rebellion, and waited in Richmond with a proffer of his
services, till the ordinance of Secession was passed. That same day, he hurried to
Harper’s Ferry, by way of Washington the “Relay,” and followed by several Virginians,
was the first mounted Rebel to rush into that storied little town. It is believed
that the movement against Harper’s Ferry was proposed and organized at
Richmond by him.</p>

<p>Turner Ashby was a <em>gentle</em> man—so quiet, taciturn, and reticent, as to be thought
morose by those who did not know him well. If a Rebel can be pious, he was so.
I have heard from two intelligent residents of Harper’s Ferry, that he especially
abominated profanity, and when in that place, last fall, he was excited for a moment
into <em>damning</em> something, he openly expressed his regret and mortification.</p>

<p>It was certain that he was not ambitious of military honors, for he was twice
offered the shoulder-straps of a brigadier general, but declined, on the ground that
he had no special military fitness, save for the command of cavalry, composed of
men whom he knew, and in a region with which he was familiar. When, finally,
he did accept the brigadier’s commission, it was for expediency, and in compliance
with urgent appeals.</p>

<p>His younger brother “Dick,” a captain in his own corps, was peculiarly endeared
to him by his fine horsemanship, and his personal intrepidity. Dick Ashby, you remember,
was killed in a desperate affair with Wallace’s Indiana Zouaves, near Patterson’s
Creek, on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. After his horse was killed,
and he was shot, he refused quarter, and kicked at our men as he lay on the ground.
It is said by all who knew him, that Turner Ashby has been a silent, but a savage,
man ever since.</p>

<p>He was about thirty-seven years old, of medium height, weighing, perhaps, 150
pounds, of very dark complexion, with deeply set black eyes, surmounted by shaggy
eye-brows, and with a most imposing beard and moustache, covering half of his face,
and falling half way down his breast.</p>

<p>He was devoted to General Jackson, and frequently declared that he should be
proud to follow him in any character, and for any duty. As for his personal courage,
it is enough to say that the very morning General Banks entered Winchester,
Ashby went to his headquarters disguised as a market man, and in reply to questions
from staff officers, described his Rebel self.</p>

<p>The day before the battle of Winchester, he rode through the streets of that
town, with one of his Captains, in Union uniform.</p>

<p>One of the most gallant Colonels in Shields’s command, who has observed Ashby
in three engagements, said in a verbal report to Government, a few days ago, that
the Black-Horse General had of late become the most reckless man to be found on
either side; that he seemed to plunge into all forms of danger with delight, riding
wherever the fire was hottest, waving his sword, discharging his pistol at our best
officers, and continually inviting hand-to-hand encounters. Our Colonel saw him
leap his horse over an abandoned gun, to make such an attack. So peculiar, by its
skill and daring, was his horsemanship, that he long ago became a marked man,
and General Shields predicted that Ashby would surely be killed before Jackson
was driven out of the valley. It was no doubt an intelligent bullet that took him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
off. A lady at Winchester said to us, “Ashby is a <em>devoted</em> man; this war has well
nigh broken his heart.” <span class="smcap lgap10">Altamont.</span></p>


<p class="center">JESSIE SCOUTS.</p>

<p>When General Fremont took charge of the Mountain Department, he proceeded
to follow his notion derived from experience in the Western frontier. He knew
that the safety and efficiency of his army in a wild wooded and rugged region, depended
upon the accuracy with which he received information of the plans and
movements of the enemy.</p>

<p>He at once called around him a set of Western frontiersmen, who had served all
through the campaign in Missouri. Some had been in the border wars of Kansas;
some had served long years on the plains, hunting the buffalo and the Indian; men
accustomed to every form of hardship, thoroughly skilled, not only in the use of
the rifle, but drilled in all cunning ways and devices to discover the intentions, position,
and strength of a foe. The best of these men were selected and placed in a
small organization called the Jessie Scouts.</p>

<p>Their name is taken from General Fremont’s wife, who remained with her husband
until his army reached New Creek, Virginia. During her stay she frequently
saw these men, and became very popular with them. Hence their present attachment
to her. They swear by her, and wear her initials upon their coats, inserted
in very modest but coarse style. They are not made prominent or ostentatiously
conspicuous. The men—and I have talked with a number of them—seem equally
devoted to Fremont himself. Their number when full is twenty-four.</p>

<p>Three of them have recently been taken, and three have been detached for service
in Halleck’s Department. Hence they number for some days only eighteen.
They have, however, been recruiting up to the full number. One of the recent
recruits whom I have seen, is a bold, dashing, fine-looking young man, a son of
Brigadier General Kelly, who has been in service in Virginia for more than a
year. He, therefore, has had frontier experience enough to qualify him for the undertaking.
He certainly possesses the pluck. Doubtless he inherited that. Their
Captain, by the way, a most remarkable character in this line of business, is Charles
Carpenter, of Kansas. Born in Ohio, he went, at the age of 16, to the border of
Missouri. Then (1854.) Kansas was wild and comparatively unsettled. He at
once, with the ardor of his character, entered upon a wild, roving life. He has
tried his hand at everything—hunting, farming, roaming, fighting Indians, Missouri
border ruffians, and occasionally “Jay-hawking.” He was at one time with Montgomery,
at another with Jennison, and again with Cleveland. He left the last
named, because, as he terms it, “things began to get too heavy even for him; he has
yet some ‘bowels of compassion left.’”</p>

<p>At the opening of the war, he was employed by Fremont, and went with him to
Springfield, actively scouting during the whole of the “Hundred days.” Before
Fremont left St. Louis, he detected, in company with another scout, two men, who
had ingeniously connected a wire, over 1,100 feet long, with the regular wire over
the North Missouri Road, and took off regularly the despatches sent by Fremont to
his officers in North Missouri. Through these men Price obtained information of
Fremont’s order to Sturgis to advance to the assistance of Mulligan at Lexington.
These two men these scouts were compelled to kill ere they could get possession of
the wire. Their bodies were found in the bottom of a neighboring river.</p>

<p>Once he entered Jeff. Thompson’s camp, when he threatened to take Cape Girardeau,
and cross the Mississippi River, upon a foray into Illinois. The agreeable
time he spent there was luxuriated in a san-insane prison, amusing the men and
officers by his curious antics and monkey tricks. For two days he drove a team for
Sterling Price, leaving his lines to procure forage, taking care not to return. Taken
prisoner with his present Lieutenant, Robb, back of Paducah, they were carried
for some distance toward Union City.</p>

<p>At night, they escaped by killing three men of the guard and the proprietor of
the house, a violent Secessionist. Taking their horses, and assuming the garb of
Confederate soldiers, they passed by Forts Henry and Donelson without the slightest
interruption. Robb’s ability to forge passes was of signal use to them in reaching
Louisville.</p>

<p>Since he has been in the valley, he has sold a horse <em>suspected of Secession proclivities</em>
to a man purchasing horses for Ashby’s Cavalry, and then tolled him and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
horses into Fremont’s camp. The purchase money, (consisting of good Confederate
notes,) and two horses, were thus restored to the Union, and a candidate for promotion
to a permanent residence at Fort Delaware procured.</p>

<p>He is bronzed, so that his neck is black by exposure to the weather and sun. The
eye is light blue, and the hair dark, with an inclination to curl. The face bears a
youthful appearance, but looks like thirty instead of twenty-five, the real age of Carpenter.
He is not above five feet six, and of high, sinewy mould. His weight is
certainly not over one hundred and thirty-five. The careless, frank, Western style
of manner and address belong to him. Heady for fight, fun or frolic, he is said to
have mingled with his dash and boldness a remarkable prudence and caution.
These qualities, united to his almost slavish devotion to Fremont, make him and his
band invaluable to that commander.</p>

<p>His dress consists of a pair of pantaloons of a dark earthen hue, darker than
buckskin. The coat is made of the dark grey material of which frontiersmen’s
hunting shirts are mostly made; it is a loose sack, trimmed in the cape and sleeves
with fringe, gathered in the back, immediately under the shoulders, in folds or
plaits. This is bound at the waist with his pistol belt. His only arm of defence,
besides the six-shooter, is a breech-loading rifle, weighing about ten pounds, and
good for eight hundred yards. Such is a short outline of the career and appearance
of one of the most marked and eccentric characters now in this valley, waging war
for the restoration of the Union.—<cite>Correspondence Philadelphia Inquirer.</cite></p></blockquote>

<p class="center"><i>From The New York Tribune, June 26, 1862.</i></p>

<p class="psig">
<span class="smcap">Senate Chamber, June</span> 5, 1862.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>: Your criticism of the President is hasty. I am confident that,
if you knew him as I do, you would not make it.</p>

<p>Of course, the President cannot be held responsible for the malfeasances of subordinates,
unless adopted, or at least tolerated by him. And I am sure that nothing
unjust or ungenerous will be tolerated, much less adopted, by him.</p>

<p>I am happy to let you know that he has no sympathy with Stanly in his absurd
wickedness, closing the schools, nor again in his other act of turning our camp into
a hunting ground for slaves. He repudiates both—positively. The latter point
has occupied much of his thought; and the newspapers have not gone too far in
recording his repeated declarations, which I have often heard from his own lips,
that slaves finding their way into the national lines are never to be re-enslaved.
This is his conviction, expressed without reserve.</p>

<p>Could you have seen the President—as it was my privilege often—while he was
considering the great questions on which he has already acted—the invitation to
emancipation in the States, emancipation in the District of Columbia, and the
acknowledgment of the independence of Hayti and Liberia—even your zeal would
have been satisfied, for you would have felt the sincerity of his purpose to do what
he could to carry forward the principles of the Declaration of Independence. His
whole soul was occupied, especially by the first proposition, which was peculiarly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
his own. In familiar intercourse with him, I remember nothing more touching
than the earnestness and completeness with which he embraced this idea. To his
mind it was just and beneficent, while it promised the sure end of slavery. Of
course to me, who had already proposed a bridge of gold for the retreating fiend,
it was most welcome. Proceeding from the President, it must take its place
among the great events of history.</p>

<p>If you are disposed to be impatient at any seeming short-comings, think, I pray
you, of what has been done in a brief period, and from the past discern the sure
promise of the future. Knowing something of my convictions and of the ardor
with which I maintain them, you may perhaps derive some assurance from my confidence.
I say to you, therefore, stand by the administration. If need be, help it
by word and act, but stand by it and have faith in it.</p>

<p>I wish that you really knew the President, and had heard the artless expression
of his convictions on those questions which concern you so deeply. You might
perhaps wish that he were less cautious, but you would be grateful that he is so
true to all that you have at heart. Believe me, therefore, you are wrong, and I
regret it the more because of my desire to see all our friends stand firmly together.</p>

<p>If I write strongly, it is because I feel strongly; for my constant and intimate
intercourse with the President, beginning with the 4th of March, not only binds
me peculiarly to his administration, but gives me a personal as well as a political
interest in seeing that justice is done him.</p>

<p>Believe me, my dear sir, with much regard, ever faithfully yours.</p>

CHARLES SUMNER.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>June 27th.</i> Subjoined is an account of the scene in Baltimore
on the arrival of the Confederate prisoners taken at Kernstown,
near Winchester, March 23d last; also, an article from
the “New York Express” on the “Freedom of the press:”</p>


<blockquote>

<p class="center">“FREEDOM” OF THE PRESS.</p>

<p>The New York Express of yesterday afternoon indulges in some courageous comments
on the new rescript of the Secretary of War, putting further and more
onerous restraints upon the publication of intelligence in the newspapers. We
subjoin a few extracts:</p>

<p>“What the personal risk is remains to be seen before a court martial selected
and created by the party that arrests. It is clear to see, that under such ‘Law,’ or
rather suspension of all Law, the business of newspaper publishing, or Journalising,
is as perilous as any on earth. Both the Property and the Life of the Journalist are
in peril—if he chances to err, in the judgment of the War Department—from
which judgment, in the matter of Property, there is no appeal, and from which
court martial selected by this War Department, there is no judicial relief, if death
be the sentence. Prudence, of course, forbids all comment upon these very extraordinary
proceedings, beyond saying that Journalism in this country, under such
martial law, must run down to what it is in Constantinople, Rome, or Vienna—that
is into mere criticisms upon the opera, or the fine arts, or puffs of court movements.</p>

<p>“What deserves especial reprehension, is—if we may be allowed thus to criticise,
with a halter around our necks,—the indulgence given such men as Wendell
Phillips, to roam the country, teaching the subversion of the Constitution and the
Laws,—while other men, of opposite politics, for exactly the same thing, are incarcerated
in Fort Warren, Fort Lafayette, or other prisons, therefor. The partiality,
the inequality, the injustice of this mode of treatment are so signal, that we
marvel the common sense of the President does not see this wrong of his ministers,
and arrest it. Upon all such partialities, and injustice, he should remember, History
is making up its record,—and that the stern Muse, which records facts, will
hold him responsible for these repeated inequalities of his Ministers.”</p>

<p>The army news,—what there is—the reader cannot be half as well informed of
as are the Confederates in Richmond, who now know much better what our army<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
is doing, than the true and loyal people of the United States. Hence, our streets
are full of all sorts of gossip, and of all sorts of lies.</p>

<p>“It was yesterday currently reported in Wall street (says the Tribune,) that a
dispatch had been received at the Navy Yard, Brooklyn, stating that the Confederate
steam battery Merrimac had left Norfolk, and was seen from our vessels in
Hampton Roads, just off Craney Island. We learn that the report was wholly unfounded.
Doubtless it was set afloat for stock jobbing purposes.”</p>

<p>The reports from the battle about Winchester, on Sunday, and of the skirmishes,
the days preceding and succeeding, are yet so obscure as but to increase the anxiety
of parties having friends and relatives on that arena. It leaks out through Harrisburg,
that the Colonel killed was Colonel Murray, of the 84th Pennsylvania, in
consequence of which the Legislature of that State adjourned on Monday—but
who are the 14 captains and lieutenants, and the 100 soldiers, none in this quarter
know.</p>

<p>Under the new rescript from Washington, or the practical translation of it, that
copying army news is as criminal as the original publication of it—it is next to impossible
to know what to publish, or what not to publish. For example, we are
not exactly sure—that the publication we make of the death of the Pennsylvania
Colonel is not a criminal publication of army news—as it does not reach us by the
Government wire.</p>

<p>The newspapers in this country are to be printed, it would seem by a fresh rescript
from the War Department, on rather more ticklish conditions than exist in
any other country, viz:—that of “warning,” “suppression,” or “imprisonment”—because
here, the summary court martial is to try offenders, and the execution of
a drum-head court is threatened.</p>

<p>Well, when any of our craft come down town in the morning, it would be well to
say “adieu” to wife and family,—for it is not at all certain, under this rescript,
that one may not be shot under drum-head law before night.</p>

<p>The proper way to put a stop to the publication of war news, is to cut off the
mails for a few days—and shut up all the channels of intelligence. But under this
rescript, a journalist is completely in the power of what, or what not, may be set
down as the publication of army news.</p>

<p>This sort of departmental fulmination, is, to say the least, as much without decorum
as without precedent. The offenders should be named, and dealt with—while
this is but a fulmination <i lang="la">in terrorem</i>.</p>

<p>The above is all very good and sensible, but our cotemporary is really silly enough
to quote an obsolete instrument called the Constitution of the United States, about
“free speech,” abridging the press, redress of grievances, etc., etc. We must,
however, do it the justice to say that it adds:</p>

<p>“But <i lang="la">cui bono</i>? Why thus vainly parade Constitutions and the Civil Law? We
are struggling—(are we not?—answer, Free Speech Abolitionists!) for the emancipation
of four million of Blacks,—but at what cost, Abolitionists? <span class="smcap">The enslavement
of 20,000,000 of whites</span>, are we not?”</p>

<p>It is scarcely invidious, in this connection, to remind our friends of the Express
that the independent journals of this city have long since become used to this “gag”
business; and we think, so far as the Constitution and personal liberty are concerned,
they went out of use about the time of the Merryman habeas corpus case?
Did not the Express approve and sanction the action of the President in that
case? We do not remember that it ever condemned the suppression of the press in
this city. If, therefore, it has itself fallen into the same coils, may we not enjoy
its “wry faces” with something of the relish we should those of a physician who is
forced to take his own medicine?</p>

<p>We find the following, pertinent to the same subject, in the Boston Post.</p>

<p>The Washington correspondent of the New York Evening Post says:</p>

<p>“Free speech and free press is something which is not yet fully understood by
pro-slavery men in this vicinity.”</p>

<p>We should think they might understand “something” about them after reading
the report of the Judiciary Committee on the censorship of the Press, as practiced
by the Post’s political friends, or by conversing with editors whose papers were denied
transportation in the mails, or by conversing with men <em>suspected</em> of having said
“something” not agreeable to certain officials, and who have been imprisoned without
accusation or trial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span></p>

<p class="center">ARRIVAL OF CONFEDERATE PRISONERS—THEY ARE CONSIGNED TO
THE CITY JAIL.</p>

<p class="center">VISITORS DENIED ADMISSION.</p>

<p>Shortly before 5 o’clock yesterday afternoon a special train arrived at the Camden
Station, from Sandy Hook, near Harper’s Ferry, having on board 236 Confederate
prisoners, said to have been captured in and about Winchester, Va., in charge
of company B, 4th Ohio regiment, Captain Bourning.</p>

<p>No notice had been given that the prisoners were expected, and the fact was not
generally known, but immediately upon the arrival of the train, and in fact before
it had fairly entered the depot, the news became circulated, and spread like wildfire.
The crowd around the depot rapidly increased, and in a very short time the
train was completely surrounded by persons all anxious to catch a glimpse of the
strangers; some out of morbid curiosity, but a majority being desirous of grasping
them by the hands, or searching among the crowd for some familiar face.</p>

<p>Leaving the depot, they filed into Howard street, and took up the line of march
to the quarters provided for them, at the City Hall. As they passed up Howard
street, the passers-by thronged the sidewalks and street corners, and the ladies, with
that independence which characterizes the Baltimore ladies, waved their handkerchiefs
to the prisoners, which was politely acknowledged by them, and many raised
their hats and returned the salutation with beaming faces and smiles of heartfelt
thanks for the sympathy expressed.</p>

<p>The demand for cakes, apples, refreshments, and everything in the shape of
edibles, was astonishing. In a very few minutes the entire stock on hand
about the depot was bought up by those assembled, who distributed them freely
among the unfortunate soldiers.</p>

<p>A large force of police soon arrived in charge of Marshal James L. McPhail, and
the crowd was forced back from the cars to enable them to disembark. They were
formed in line two abreast, the Federal soldiers and the police flanking them upon
either side. As they passed out of the depot, the multitude, which had increased
to several thousand, pressed forward, and shook hands with many of them, expressing
sympathy for them in their misfortune.</p>

<p>Many of the dwellings along the route presented a lively appearance, as the windows
were occupied by men, women, and children, many of them waving hats and
handkerchiefs; others, however, gave vent to their feelings by hooting, hissing, and
giving vent to all sorts of disapprobation; some exclaiming, “There’s a specimen
of your Southern chivalry;” “Oh, what a set of ragamuffins,” &amp;c. The prisoners
looked defiance at them, however, and treated all such, who so expressed themselves,
with the utmost contempt.</p>

<p>Passing into Madison street, they proceeded towards the jail, followed by an
immense crowd. When near the jail building, a citizen living in the vicinity
appeared at his window, with several children, who shouted vociferously for Jeff.
Davis, whereupon several of the prisoners turned towards them, and became so excited
as to take up the shout, and, despite the presence of the armed guard, cheered
for Jeff. Davis with a hearty good will, raising their caps to those in the windows.</p>

<p>The crowd caught the infection, and shouts of “Go it boys; them’s my sentiments;”
“We ain’t all Yankees here, nary a time;” “We’re with you if we had a
chance;” and similar exclamations were heard. Arriving at the jail gate, the
crowd made another rush to get an opportunity to shake hands, but were pressed
back, and the prisoners were marched inside the jail building and delivered over to
Captain James, who provided them with quarters in the northern corridor of the
building.</p>

<p>The outside gate was soon besieged by a large number of people, all claiming the
right to enter upon various pretexts. Quite a number did obtain ingress, and conversed
freely with the prisoners, who seemed quite communicative and gratified at
the attention paid to them.</p>

<p>A majority of them are very young men and are very intelligent. A great many
present the appearance of being farmers and laborers, many of whom state that
they were only “Home Guards,” and not attached to the regular army, and were
captured at their homes, and not in the battle at Winchester. Of this, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
we know nothing, except that the Federals claim them as prisoners of war. They
are nearly all from the neighborhood of Staunton, Va. So far as we have been
able to learn there are no Baltimoreans among them, as reported. They are a very
hardy looking body of men, but rather rough in outward appearance, having doubtless
been in active service for several months past. The uniforms, which are of
grey, are warm and comfortable.</p>

<p>They were provided last evening with refreshments by the gentlemanly warden
of the jail, Captain James, who renders them as comfortable as circumstances will
admit.</p>

<p>At an early hour this morning numbers of persons assembled at the jail to obtain
an interview, and among them many of the first ladies of the city, who were anxious
to relieve their wants, but an order was received to close the gates, and all
communication even to the press was denied. We are informed, however, that any
packages of clothing or delicacies sent to them will be delivered to them by the
authorities. Among the party are eighteen non-commissioned officers, who are very
intelligent and gentlemanly, and all of whom seem thoroughly wrapt up heart and
soul in the Southern cause.</p></blockquote>

<p>I am more and more disgusted every day at the very sight of
dark blue uniforms—in proportion to my attachment to the
South, is my indignant wrath at her enemies. Let us have no
terms to make with the hordes and vandals who seek to destroy
us by the most unscrupulous and barbarous warfare the world
has ever known. Would that I had the power to scatter
them like chaff with the breath of my mouth!</p>

<p><i>June 29th.</i> It is generally believed by the prisoners that we
have badly whipped the Yankees before Richmond. Yankee
newspapers try to conceal it, but their conflicting accounts of
battles betray their efforts to pervert the truth. May it be so,
and if so, <i lang="la">Deo Gratias!</i> The Yankee officers here say that
General McClellan is certainly on “Church Hill.”</p>

<p><i>June 30th.</i> The editor of the “Baltimore American” has
been arrested, it is said, for publishing the accounts of the battles
before Richmond <em>too soon</em>. Having met with the subjoined
address, I record it as a part of the current history of the times:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center"><i>Address of the Democratic Members of Congress to the Democracy
of the United States.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fellow-Citizens</span>:—The perilous condition of our country
demands that we should reason together. Party organization,
restricted within proper limits, is a positive good, and indeed
essential to the preservation of public liberty. Without it the
best government would soon degenerate into the worst of tyrannies.
In despotisms the chief use of power is in crushing
out party opposition. In our country the experience of the past
twelve months proves, more than any lesson in history, the necessity
of party organization. The present administration was
chosen by a party, and in all civil acts and appointments has
recognized, and still does, its fealty and obligations to that party.
<em>There must and will be an opposition.</em> The public safety and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
good demand it. The Democratic party was founded more than
sixty years ago. It has never been disbanded. To-day it numbers
one million five hundred thousand electors in the States still
loyal to the Union. Its recent numerous victories in municipal
elections in the Western and Middle States proves its vitality.
Within the last ten months it has held State Conventions, and
nominated full Democratic tickets in every free State in the
Union. Of no other party opposed to the Republicans can the
same be said. Shall the Democratic party be now disbanded?
Why should it? Are its ancient principles wrong? What are
they? Let its platforms for thirty years speak:</p>

<p>“<em>Resolved</em>, That the American Democracy place their trust
in the intelligence, the patriotism, and the discriminating justice
of the American people, That we regard this as a distinctive
feature in our political creed, which we are proud to maintain
before the world, as the great moral element in a form of
government, springing from and upheld by the popular will;
and we contrast it with the creed and practice of Federalism,
under whatever name and form which seeks to palsy the will of
the constituent, and which conceives no imposture too monstrous
for the public credulity. That the Federal Government
is one of limited power, derived <em>solely</em> from the constitution,
and the grants of power made therein ought to be strictly
construed by all the departments and agents of the government;
and that it is <em>inexpedient</em> and <em>dangerous</em> to exercise doubtful
constitutional powers.”</p></blockquote>

<p>And as explanatory of these the following from Mr. Jefferson’s
inaugural: “The support of the State Governments in
all their rights as the most complete administration of our domestic
concerns, and the surest bulwarks against anti-Republican
tendencies. The preservation of the General Government
in its whole constitutional vigor, as the sheet anchor of our peace
at home and safety abroad.” Such, Democrats, are the principles
of your party, essential to public liberty, and to the stability
and wise administration of the government, alike in peace
and war. They are the principles upon which the Constitution
and Union were founded; and under the control of a party
which adheres to them, the constitution would be maintained,
and the Union could not be dissolved.</p>

<p>This morning Lieutenant Holmes (one of the Yankee officers)
came up to our room and enquired “who has been talking
to a man outside through the bars?” “No one in this
room,” was the reply, when he went out, looking as if he
believed we were falsifying. Soon Lieutenant Holmes, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
“Mullet-head,” as the “boys” call him, returned and said, “I
have the <em>culprit</em>.” The gentleman on the street to whom the
prisoner was talking was arrested, and the prisoner himself put
in solitary confinement. Some two weeks ago two little girls
were arrested for waving their handkerchiefs to prisoners, and a
little child who could not speak plainly for saying “Hoowaugh
for Bowaygard.”</p>

<p><i>July 2d.</i> A little girl, 12 years of age, was arrested to-day
for wearing an apron like the Confederate Dag. The surgeon of
this prison is known as “Cyclops” among us. A week ago
“Cyclops” said “our forces are about now in Richmond—the
Anaconda is gradually coiling around the last vital point of the
rebellious monster.” What does he think now? The “New
York Times” acknowledges the loss of upwards of twenty pieces
of artillery in one fight. The Yankee papers a week ago reported
General Thomas C. Hindman, of Arkansas, as certainly
dead.</p>

<p>In yesterday’s paper is the following telegram:—“Advices
from Arkansas are to the effect that General Hindman, with
some five thousand rebels was in the immediate vicinity of the
St. Charles,” and that Colonel Fitch had abandoned the forts,
spiking the guns. The situation of General Curtis is said to
be critical, he being unable to obtain supplies, and his army
having been on half rations for a week:</p>


<blockquote>

<p class="center">THE FATE OF RICHMOND.</p>

<p>We expected to have been able to announce in our yesterday afternoon’s edition
the important fact that Richmond was, in possession of General McClellan’s
army. From sources of information which we deemed trustworthy, we, however,
believe that the fact was known in this city yesterday afternoon, and also communicated
by the authorities here to Washington, but for reasons no doubt satisfactory,
an official recognition of the fact was withheld by the War Department. Our
theory of the case is this: Although the city is in our power or possession, yet the
Rebel army is still in arms, but is so situated that it can neither escape from the
coils of the anaconda with which McClellan enfolds it, nor has it the means of
obtaining supplies; neither can it attack our forces, who hold the possession of the
bridges over the Chickahominy, which are controlled by our heavy artillery, and
there is no other means of access to McMillan, it being impossible for the Rebels
to get through the marshes adjacent to the river. The result must be that the
Rebels must surrender or starve, as they can neither fight or skedaddle. They
are in a <em>fix</em>.</p>

<p>This, as before remarked, is our theory of the matter, and the government withholds
the official intelligence of the taking of Richmond, until it can accompany
it with the additional gratifying announcement, which probably they may be able
to make in time to send to England by the steamer which sails to-day, of the capture
not only of Richmond, but of the entire Rebel army. For giving this <em>opinion</em>,
we hope we may not be called upon to keep our neighbor company at Fort McHenry.—<cite>Baltimore

<p class="center">FUGITIVE SLAVE CASE IN ALEXANDRIA.</p>

<p>We take the following particulars of a slave case in Alexandria,
Virginia, from the News of June 24:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>John Hunter, a citizen of Prince George county, in the State of Maryland,
applied to Lewis McKenzie, a justice of the peace of Alexandria county, Virginia,
for a warrant to arrest certain slaves of his, supposed to be in this city. Having
taken and subscribed the following oath, required before the magistrate would
grant a warrant:</p>

<p><i>State of Virginia, Alexandria County:</i> I, John Hunter, of the county of Prince
George, in the State of Maryland, do solemnly swear that I am a true and loyal
citizen of the United States, and that I will support the constitution thereof as the
supreme law of the land; and that I will, to the extent of my abilities, uphold
and maintain it. I will, to the utmost of my power, give information of every
danger which may threaten it, so help me God.</p>

<p class="psig">
JOHN HUNTER.
</p>

<p>Sworn to before me this 21st day of June, 1862.</p>

<p class="psig">
LEWIS McKENZIE, <i>J. P.</i>
</p>

<p>A warrant was accordingly granted, and one of Mr. Hunter’s negroes, on Saturday
last, was apprehended, and the officers were conveying him to the ferry boat
for transportation home, there being no doubt of its being Mr. Hunter’s servant
from the evidence of parties present, satisfactory to the magistrate. Not pleased
with the summary proceedings of the parties executing the warrant, the negro
refused to accompany them, when they essayed gentle “coercion.” This not meeting
with the approbation of the negro, was creating some excitement, and promised
to lead to serious difficulty, when some of the provost guard interposed and carried
the case before Colonel Gregory, the Provost Marshal, who retained possession of
the negro until the 23d, when a decision was rendered. After receiving the statements
of Mayor McKenzie, Mr. Hunter and his friends, the negro and others, in
connection with the report of the guard, the Marshal refused to acknowledge the
claim of Mr. Hunter, and released the man, stating that he would not permit the
arrest of any fugitive from labor while in command of this post, thus setting aside
the lawful authority of the State of Virginia. The case will be reported to the
President at an early day.</p>


<p class="center">A SECESSIONIST.</p>

<p>A friend in this city tells us of a little boy, a neighbor of his, who took great
pleasure in a beautiful play-ball painted with our own national colors. While enjoying
his play on the sidewalk recently, the ball accidentally rolled into a neighbor’s
basement. It was returned to him after a while, with the red, white and blue
washed off, and a Secesh flag painted on instead. Comment is needless.</p>

<p>A gentleman from Chicago relates a remarkable fact in connection with the Rebel
prisoners at Chicago. The Rebel prisoners number about eight thousand, and,
of course, there are among them men of intelligence and education, but the great
numbers are deplorably ignorant. Colonel Mulligan has these Rebels in charge,
and as they have considerable leisure time he has established a Yankee school for
their instruction. The educated prisoners were assigned as teachers, and the work
is progressing rapidly.</p>

<p>Two discharged members of the fourteenth regiment of regulars, who have just
arrived at Syracuse, New York, from Perryville, Maryland, state that about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
first of last February the Rebel sympathizers in that town poisoned the wells, from
which the men were in the habit of procuring their drinking water, and that, as a
consequence, two hundred members of the regiment died, and of the remaining
seven hundred, hardly one has recovered his health.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Wm. P. Wood, superintendent, informed us this evening
that the prisoners here will be removed to Fort Delaware on to-morrow.</p>

<p><i>July 4th.</i> Captain Higgins and Lieutenant J. Miller have
treated us since our confinement here with comparative kindness,
and all the prisoners have become somewhat attached to them
on that account. Their conduct towards us has been a pleasing
contrast with the uncouth bearing and tyranny in petty things
of other officers. The following will explain itself.</p>

<p>At a meeting held this morning, in room No. 3, the following
preamble and resolution were unanimously adopted:</p>

<p>“Whereas Captain Benjamin D. Higgins and Lieutenant J.
Miller (as officers connected with this prison) have by their gentlemanly,
courteous and soldierly bearing towards us, won our
esteem and respect,</p>

<p><em>Therefore, be it Resolved</em>, That it is with regret that we part
with these gentlemen, inasmuch as they have exemplified that
urbane and respectful bearing, even in our present relations with
each other, is not incompatible with the faithful discharge of a
soldier’s duty.”</p>

<p>Captain E. Pliny Bryan was called to the chair, and a committee
of three was appointed to hand these resolutions to the
above named.</p>

<p>About half past 10, A.M., we started in charge of Lieutenant
J. B. Mix, of “Scott’s nine hundred,” for the depot, where we
were detained an hour. United States soldiers and citizens
crowded around the cars. Beyond the expressions of a few intoxicated
men, nothing insulting was said to us, but great
anxiety was manifested to converse with us, which, in every instance,
was prohibited. Several persons, however, stepped up
under the windows of the cars, covered their mouths with their
hands, and said in an under tone, “I’m Secesh, and sympathize
with you.” One, while he did this, dropped two gold dollars
into the hands of a prisoner, enquiring audibly, “How are you,
brother Jim?” A lady requested the officer in charge to allow
her to speak to her <em>cousin</em>, and she was permitted to do so. Her
cousin, Lieutenant S., then received from her a card, on which
was written the name of a lady he had known in Charleston,
South Carolina, In return he handed her a card, on which was
a likeness of President Davis, and she seemed delighted at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
exchange. On the departure of the train from the depot, the
prisoners vociferously cheered for Davis, Beauregard and Johnston.
Arrived in Baltimore at 2, P.M. As we moved along
the streets in the same cars, drawn by horses to the Philadelphia
depot, the prisoners sang Southern songs, and cheered for
Davis, while men and women, concealed behind obstacles and
windows, were seen to waive handkerchiefs at them. Notwithstanding
the array of bayonets and swords, down-trodden Southern
feeling was thus made apparent. At this time a Confederate
Lieutenant hallooed for Beauregard, and a Yankee officer replied,
“D—n Beauregard, I wish he was in h—ll, where you
ought to be.” As we advanced towards Philadelphia, we found
the Secession feeling growing less. Passing a small town in
Pennsylvania, a “Louisiana Tiger” cried out, “Hurrah for
Jackson,” and a woman replied, “Go to h—ll.” At Havre de
Grace, in Maryland, the “tiger” above mentioned, displayed a
small Confederate flag, whereupon an overgrown inebriated
fellow said, “I can whip the man that showed that flag if the
officer in charge will let us have a fair open fight.” The officer
took the flag away from the “tiger,” and told the man, in a joke,
that he might “have a fair open fight,” but the man, I suppose,
thought discretion the better part of valor, for he declined
to accept the privilege. Lieutenant J. B. Mix, the officer in
charge, proved himself a very clever gentleman, and did all he
could to make us as comfortable as circumstances would allow.
We arrived in Philadelphia at 12 o’clock at night. As late as
it was a small crowd had collected at the depot, and there was
a great disposition manifested to talk with us—some few seemed
inclined to talk rationally and calmly, while others made this
an occasion to vent their venom freely, which latter invariably
recoiled upon them with “good measure pressed down, heaped
up and running over.” Had not an officer interfered, they
would have torn a Louisianian “to pieces,” as they said. An
old woman remarked, “My husband and three sons are before
Richmond, and I wish I had more to send. I wish they would
let me kill them rebels. Why don’t they kill ’em?” Many loose
remarks were made, such as “they have no free schools, and
are so ignorant,” “they want a monarchy,” &amp;c., &amp;c. Lieutenant
Mix went to get us something to eat at a restaurant, but
was refused, the keeper saying he would sell nothing to rebels,
and he hoped we would starve. Some of the people said that
the “Southerners” treated their prisoners very badly, which
was stoutly denied. Mr. Olden from Aldie, Virginia, told them
that he was kept four days handcuffed without anything to eat,
and the crowd agreed that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span> “he ought not to have had anything
to eat—any man that would turn traitor to his country.” In a
conversation with a Federal officer the latter was frank enough
to say that he wished we had peace; he was tired of the war;
would resign if he could do so without disgrace; that if the
North backed down now, they would be a ruined and a disgraced
people, and that they were fighting for their very existence.</p>

<p>At 5 o’clock we left Philadelphia for Fort Delaware, which is
forty miles south-west of “the city of brotherly love?” We
were evidently brought this circuitous rout for display—to lead
the people to believe we were prisoners from Richmond. Arrived
at the fort at 10 o’clock, A.M.—a gloomy looking place. At
the west end of the fort the roll was called immediately on our
entrance in the yard. As the names were called the officers
were ordered inside the fort, and the non-commissioned officers
and privates to an enclosure like a sheep-pen. Captain A. Gibson,
commandant of the post, seemed to endeavor by harsh expressions
and manner to intimidate the prisoners. Assuming
us much ferocity as possible, he would say, “Why don’t you
answer to your name, sir?” “Speak louder, walk along faster,”
&amp;c., &amp;c.; but he always had thrust back at him as harsh language
as he could adopt. A Louisianian, after replying “here,”
in a stentorian voice, as his name was called, <em>gave old Gibson a
look of vengeance</em>, and the latter remarked, “A damned impudent
scoundrel.” Lieutenant Mix, (the officer in charge of
the prisoners from Washington to Fort Delaware,) told us that
the train in which we came to Philadelphia was expected at the
latter place four hours earlier than it arrived, and that had we
been up to time, we would probably have been mobbed, for about
two thousand had assembled and waited an hour at the depot
for us for that purpose. As it was, two of the prisoners were
struck with rocks, one on the head, and the other in the side.</p>

<p><i>July 6th.</i> Our monotonous confinement furnishes but little
worthy of record, but memory leads me back to our experience
at the Philadelphia depot; and I laugh at what was said and
done by the bitter and misguided fanatics. An old woman came
up under the car window and asked Captain S. very seriously,
“When will this war end?” to which the Captain replied,
“Madam, when all of your troops are withdrawn from our soil”—a
man who standing by, who had been boring us for some time
with his Bombastes Furiosi talk, said to Captain S., “I wish I
had you out of the cars, I’d take your heart out”—this same
man had the impudence to try to draw Major H. into conversation
with him, but the latter told him, “I want nothing to say
to you—you insulted my friend, and you might insult me,” and
the man walked off like a dog with his tail between his legs. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
pleasant-looking fellow, with a seemingly inexhaustible flask of
whiskey in his pocket, and good humor issuing from every pore
of his jolly countenance, was passing from car to car, (while we
were waiting so long at the Philadelphia depot,) and discussing
with evident satisfaction to himself the great question which divided
the late “United States.” At length we all became
heartily tired of his witticisms, and one after another “poohed”
and “pshawed” at him. At this he became very angry, and
began to use Billingsgate language pretty freely, but throughout
his antics he came off No. 2.</p>

<p><i>July 7th.</i> The New York Herald attempts to prove Horace
Greeley a Secessionist, by quotations from his own paper:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><i>From the Tribune of November 9, 1860.</i></p>

<p>If the cotton States shall become satisfied that they can do better out of the Union
than in it, we insist on letting them go in peace. The right to secede may be a revolutionary
one; but it exists, nevertheless. * * * We must ever resist the right
of any State to remain in the Union and nullify or defy the laws thereof. To withdraw
from the Union is quite another matter; and whenever a considerable section
of our Union shall deliberately resolve to go out, we shall resist all coercive measures
designed to keep it in. We hope never to live in a Republic whereof one
section is pinned to another by bayonets.</p>

<p class="center"><i>From the Tribune of November 26, 1860.</i></p>

<p>If the cotton States unitedly and earnestly wish to withdraw peacefully from the
Union, we think they should and would be allowed to do so. Any attempt to compel
them by force to remain would be contrary to the principles enunciated in the
immortal Declaration of Independence, contrary to the fundamental ideas on which
human liberty is based.</p>

<p class="center"><i>From the Tribune of December 17, 1860.</i></p>

<p>If it (the Declaration of Independence) justified the secession from the British
empire of three millions of colonists in 1776, we do not see why it would not justify
the secession of five millions of Southerners from the Union in 1861.</p>

<p class="center"><i>From the Tribune of February 23, 1861.</i></p>

<p>We have repeatedly said, and we once more insist, that the great principle embodied
by Jefferson in the Declaration of American Independence, that governments
derive their just power from the consent of the governed, is sound and just;
and that, if the slave States, the cotton States, or the Gulf States only, choose to
form an independent nation, they have a clear moral right to do so. * * * *
Whenever it shall be clear that the great body of the Southern people have become
conclusively alienated from the Union, and anxious to escape from it, we shall do
our best to forward their views.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>July 18th.</i> There is said to be about 3,000 prisoners confined
at this fort, the majority of which are in a pen, which is called
“the barracks,” and which I shall more fully describe hereafter.
The men sleep two on a board, about three feet wide—are compelled
to cut their hair short—are marched and countermarched
about an hour every day—felt all over by the Dutch sergeants,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
and made to bring water and do other work about the garrison.
They have “coffee-water” sometimes, and a piece of bread six
by three inches, and a small piece of meat scarcely fit for a dog
to eat, for breakfast; “soup-water” for dinner, with bread about
the dimensions above, and “coffee-water” for supper, and bread
same as at breakfast and dinner. They drink river water, which
is really offensive to the smell. The privy they use is intolerably
filthy, and accommodation for three thousand is not large
enough for three hundred.</p>

<p>A Yankee soldier who attempted to escape from this fort,
where he was on duty, was sentenced to carry the ball and chain
four hours every day for five months! He has been carrying it
three months now. I see the poor fellow every day from my
window, and he appears to be in much suffering. The following,
in regard to this fort, is from the “Philadelphia Enquirer.”</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Fort Delaware and the Rebel Prisoners.</span>—There are, at the present time,
3,181 rebel prisoners confined at Fort Delaware, and about 3,000 more expected at
the end of next week. The steamer Baltic arrived at the Fort on Saturday last,
having on board 1,200 prisoners, who were transferred from Governor’s Island, New
York, to Fort Delaware; they comprise the whole number quartered at Governor’s
Island. The rumors of an outbreak recently of the prisoners at the Fort have no
foundation in fact. While it is conceded by officers of the Fort that a determined
attempt at capture would create trouble, no ultimate good to the rebels could possibly
result.</p>

<p>The prisoners, with the exception of the rebel officers, who are about one hundred
in number, and who have quarters inside the Fort, occupy barracks on the
upper end of the Island. These barracks are commanded by heavy casemate guns
in the Fort, and also by shotted field pieces. A strong guard also patrols the Island
at all hours, to prevent any attempt at escape. The barracks erected are capable
of accommodating 2,000 men. Other barracks are in course of erection, intended
to accommodate 5,000 more. The guard consists of about 250 men, comprising
portions of three batteries.</p>

<p>Recruiting is going on in this city to fill these batteries to the required standard,
and with flattering success. Lieutenant Wm. G. Rohrman is employed in this service,
and a considerable number are recruited and sent down daily. The troops
are encamped on the meadows near the Fort. One company, numbering about
sixty men and about thirty regulars, are stationed inside. A hospital has been
built near the barracks for the sick and wounded rebels, and every attention given
to them.</p></blockquote>


<p class="center"><i>Extracts from proceedings in the United States House of Representatives.</i></p>

<p><i>Mr. Mallory, of Kentucky.</i> I think the slaves of Southern
rebels should be used as our armies advance in all menial service,
such as boating and assisting in the fortifications. My reasons
against arming them are—1st. That when armed they
would be turned against those who had been their masters, and
their practice will be an indiscriminate slaughter of men, women
and children. 2d. You cannot for your lives make of
slaves an army whose services in the field will pay the expense
of organizing them. One shot from a cannon would disperse
thirty thousand of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span></p>

<p><i>Mr. Stevens, of Pennsylvania.</i> Then they will do injury to
the rebels who fight them. I am for employing them against
their masters. I suppose the gentleman wants to employ the
slaves in a menial service, and after the war return them to their
masters under the fugitive slave law. I would raise 100,000
to-morrow. They are not barbarians, and are as much calculated
to be humane as any class of people. It is false to say they
will not make good soldiers. I would seize every foot of land
and dollar of property, and apply them to the army as we go
along. I would plant in the South military colonies, and sell
the land to soldiers of freedom, holding the heritage of traitors,
and building up institutions without the recognition of slavery.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Wickliffe, of Kentucky.</i> It is a miserable policy to muster
runaway blacks into service. If twenty million of freemen
cannot suppress a rebellion of six millions of white men, let the
acknowledgment at once be made.</p>

<p><i>July 9th.</i> On the 4th of July President Davis, dressed in
full regimentals, after the ceremony of a mock trial, was hung
in effigy in west Philadelphia.</p>

<p>A prisoner, attached to a Virginia regiment, was taken sick
last night, and carried from the barracks to the hospital <em>at 9
o’clock</em>, <em>and was buried at 10 o’clock</em>. Quick work!</p>

<p>I shall have been here a week the day after to-morrow. We
are so closely confined that it seems like a month on account of
the “weary, lagging hours.” A fellow prisoner says he has been
here a month, and he has to write 1862 every day, so as not to
forget it, for it appears like 1863.</p>

<p><i>July 10th.</i> One of the modes adopted here, in order to tantalize
us, is to tell us we “are to be paroled or exchanged to-morrow.”
This once had the effect to fill the prisoners with the
roseate hues of hope, but disappointment had so often been the
result of such announcements, that we no longer listen to them
with credit.</p>

<p>The Yankees certainly do not desire the release of Colonel
Corcoran, nor have they ever desired it. His confinement appeals
too strongly to the Irish to volunteer, and about this time
particularly volunteers are much needed.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Fessenden, of Maine</i>, said in the Senate yesterday, “There
is another thing I think a great mistake, and that is the attempt
to deceive the people by calling a defeat “a great strategic
movement.”” He thought the people should be trusted, and told
the whole truth as to what was wanted by the country. Deal
with them honestly, and every true Northern heart will respond,
deal with enemies as enemies, and friends as friends. It is folly
to hesitate to tell the people of this country exactly what the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
state of things is. He had been amused by seeing a call upon
the different Governors for 300,000 troops, which simply meant
that the President and Government thought they would want
more troops. The enemy knows this, everybody knows it, then
why not tell the truth?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Rice, Senator from Minnesota, said</i>: “The time had
come when we must either recognise the Southern Confederacy,
or speedily put it down—use all the means in our power to do
so. Must we, when the rebels resort to all sorts of means, fail
from any sickly notions, and refrain from using all the means in
our power to meet and suppress the rebellion? He would not
hesitate for a moment to vote for any measure that would put the
rebellion to an end.”</p>

<p><i>Mr. Wilson, of Massachusetts</i>, was in favor of fighting the
battle to a successful issue, and drafting if necessary, but he
agreed with the Senator from Maine that this style of rose-water
must cease, that it would be better to tell the whole truth to
the people, and not attempt to deceive them. <em>It seemed as if
we had an organized system of lying in this country.</em> “He
thought the censorship of the press had been a great disadvantage.”</p>

<p>Most of the articles in the newspapers in reference to the war
are simply malicious falsehoods, the creation of base minds and
evil hearts.</p>

<p>The Washington correspondent of the Philadelphia Enquirer
says: “Lieutenant Clure, of the 92d Ohio, with 28 rebel
prisoners from the Shenandoah Valley, arrived to-day, and
while en route to the Provost Marshal’s office they were taken
to a Secession house on C Street, and feasted for several hours,
and then taken to a number of drinking saloons by Secesh sympathisers.”</p>

<p><i>July 11th.</i> Joseph C. Paul, a private in Company K, Pennsylvania
Zouaves, says in a letter dated James river, July 5th,
to a friend in Philadelphia, “We are now lying near James
river, and rest assured that if the enemy attack us again before
we are prepared, it will not be a loss of five nights’ sleep to us
as before, as we will occupy Richmond as sure as fate. This is
the opinion of distinguished officers.”</p>

<p>Lincoln has gone on a visit to the army of the Potomac, accompanied
by P. H. Watson, assistant Secretary of War.</p>

<p>The “Philadelphia Evening Bulletin” says General Burnside
has promptly brought his fine division of veterans, who have
won laurels at Roanoke Island and Newbern, to James river,
and they are now joined to the army of the Potomac.</p>

<p>Captain Gibson tells us to-day that arrangements have been
made for an immediate exchange of prisoners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span></p>

<p>The Philadelphia Enquirer says, “Major Trumbull, of the
first Connecticut artillery, has arrived in town, and is fast recovering
from an attack of the Chickahominy fever.” It is presumed
that the Major referred to is not the only one suffering
from the Chickahominy fever about this time.</p>

<p><i>July 12th.</i> Gold is riz, and, in the language of the poet, it
threatens to be rizzer. Some Yankee financiers argue that gold
is not up, but that paper is down! This question between pecuniary
tweedledee and tweedledum seems to puzzle the <i lang="la">quid
nuncs</i> since the retreat of McClellan.</p>

<p>A sergeant escaped from the barracks last night. He lives in
Baltimore. To all intents and purposes Captain Gibson, in
command of this post, is a prisoner on the island, whose only
consolation seems to be to exercise his petty tyranny over “rebel”
prisoners. There are men whose nature has a peculiar affinity
for anything petty, mean, and bad. They fly upon it like a vulture
upon carrion. I discover that it is the policy of the Yankees
to allow those in immediate attendance on the inmates of
prisons to <em>seem</em> to grant them some indulgences <em>at times</em>, in order
to gain their confidence, and arrive at their secrets. Some
ladies from Delaware visited the Fort yesterday, and when concealed
behind pillars, so as not to be seen by the officers of the
Fort, they waved their handkerchiefs at the prisoners. After
they left, they sent a request, clandestinely, to them for “Secession
buttons.” The ladies, as a general thing, North and South,
seem to be with us. This speaks well for the <em>heart</em> of the
Southern people, for this is the commodity ladies deal in.</p>

<p><i>July 13th.</i> From Yankee newspapers it seems that gold has
become scarce, since it has risen so in value:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">The Gold and the Silver</div>
   <div class="verse indent2">Have vanished and fled,</div>
   <div class="verse">And people must carry</div>
   <div class="verse indent2">Shinplasters instead.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>A gentleman from Florida, who has been a prisoner at Fort
Lafayette, in New York harbor, was brought here yesterday. At
Fort Lafayette he has been in double irons since the 27th of
April last, because it was alleged that he was a captain of a
band of guerillas to hang Union men. He is a private attached
to the 3d Florida regiment, Colonel Dilworth. The Yankees
have threatened to hang him several times. He was captured
at St. Johns, while within an hundred yards of his house,
whither he was going on furlough. A sermon was preached in
the Fort this evening, and my friend Lieutenant W., who has
fortunately a religious turn of mind, heard it, and informs me
that it was a fine effort, although emanating from a Yankee.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
The gist of it was that religion is not incompatible with a soldier’s
life. For my own part, I believe that as no good can come
out of Nazareth, or pure water from a foul spring, so nothing
sincere can fall from a Yankee’s lips.</p>

<p>Look at “Old Gip” (Captain Gibson) as he winds about the
yard of the fort! His slim figure is made all the slimmer by
tight pantaloons. He walks with as quick a step as his left leg
twisted at an angle of forty-seven degrees will permit. He carries
his chin as if conscious of a stiff cravat, and his old palm
leaf hat is set with a knowing inclination to the left ear. “Old
Gip” is a tall, spare and ungainly looking man, of about fifty
years of age, with a pale ascetic countenance, which carries with
it an expression vibrating between low suspicion and vulgarity.
His hair is cut tolerably close, close enough to display in their
full proportions a large pair of ears, which stand out in “relief”
like turrets from a watch-tower, and with pretty much the same
object. His beard is short, and of pepper and salt color, and
he has a malicious twinkling eye. Most persons have some prevailing
characteristic, which usually gives tone and color to all
their thoughts and actions, forming what we denominate <em>temperament</em>.
The temperament of “Old Gip” seems to take delight
in being as rough, uncouth, and disobliging as possible to
all whom cruel fate has brought with the unfortunate limits of
his tyranny. Occasionally the officers are allowed to walk on
the parapet of the fort for recreation for about an half hour.
Any conversation with the sentinels is strictly forbidden, and for
not observing the rule in this respect, some officers have been
placed in solitary confinement. Not long since, while the Confederate
officers were walking on the parapet, they noticed a vessel
approaching with a flag, which, at a distance, looked exactly
like the Confederate flag, and the conversation became general
upon the subject, in the course of which, one of the officers observed,
in a jocular way, that he believed it was the “stars and
bars,” and said, “Hurrah for Jeff Davis.” Soon the sentinel
informed us, “Your time is up,” and we had scarcely reached
our quarters when the officer above referred to received a note
from “Old Gip,” in which the Yankee functionary used this
language: “For this, your first offence, I <em>warn</em> you, but for a
repetition of the crime, may God have mercy on your soul!”
The sentinel must have informed Captain Gibson of the <em>crime</em>,
for the latter was not within hearing when the remark was made.</p>

<p><i>July 14th.</i> An old Dutch soldier in the fort said to-day, “I
don’t care which side whips by Got, so I gets my thirteen dollars
a month.” Another Yankee soldier remarked to a prisoner,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
“You have plenty of friends in this yard, but we must keep
mum.” Captain Gibson has just issued an order preventing prisoners
from receiving money from their friends, but allows them
to buy necessaries from the sutler, and give an order on him when
he has funds in his hands belonging to a prisoner. This is caused
by the escape of several prisoners lately, for it is supposed that the
sentinels were bribed by the parties who escaped.</p>

<p>The Black Republican members of the United States Congress
are as far from mixing with the Democrats as oil with water. The
two are always quarrelling in spite of the fact, that the Black Republicans
are ever trying to be a little more Democratic, while the
Democrats make constant efforts to be a little “Republican.” In
this way the Black Republicans are like onions rubbed with Democratic
spices; the strong original nigger odor is blended with
new and foreign matter. However much the Democrats aim to
conceal the fact, it is quite plain that Black Republican Onion
offends Democratic nostrils, while the new Democratic spice is
quite unwelcome to the genuine Black Republican.</p>

<p><i>July 15th.</i> Ten prisoners escaped last night. From a Northern
paper I learn that the following dispatch has just been received
at the War Department, “Nashville,” July 14th. It was the
ninth, instead of the eleventh Michigan regiment, that surrendered
at Murfreesboro’, Tennessee. The eleventh arrived at the camp
near the Davisville Fair Grounds, yesterday afternoon, after an unsuccessful
three days’ chase after Morgan. Three members of
Hewitt’s battery, who escaped from Murfreesboro’, report that the
battery and the third Minnesota surrendered to the rebels. Colonel
Duffield is mortally wounded, and General T. A. Crittenden,
of Indiana, taken prisoner.</p>

<p>Mrs. Phillips, who was not long since released from the old capital
prison at Washington city, and sent South, has been again
arrested by an order from “Beast Butler,” on the charge of
“mocking” at the funeral remains of Lieutenant De Kay, and
imprisoned in one of the houses on Ship Island, intended for hospital
purposes, where she is to be allowed one female servant, and
no more, and a soldier’s ration a day, with the means of cooking
it. Another order from the same source sentences Fidel Keller or
Kelti to two years’ hard labor on Ship Island for exhibiting in his
bookstore window a skeleton labelled “Chickahominy.” A
third order sentences John W. Audins to hard labor for two years,
for having exhibited a cross, which he said was fashioned from
the bones of a Yankee soldier.</p>

<p>Lincoln has just had an interview with the members of Congress
from the border States, the object of which is said to have
been to impress upon them the necessity of urging their respective
States to adopt the gradual emancipation policy, in order to
avoid, says the New York Express, “immediate and bloody abolition.”
The telegraph reports that General Curtis, (who is en<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>deavoring
to retreat through Arkansas to the Mississippi river, opposite
Memphis,) is suffering terribly for want of forage and supplies.
Also, on Monday, his command was at Jacksonport, and
General Hindman had ordered the railroad bridge at Madison to
be burned, to prevent Curtis from passing in that direction, and
had also required all the inhabitants near Gauley bridge to burn
their provisions and shoot their cattle, lest they should be seized
by foraging parties sent out by Curtis. Charges have been preferred
against General Mitchell by the division formerly commanded
by him in North Alabama. He is accused of having permitted
a portion of his troops to perpetrate upon the people of
North Alabama “deeds of cruelty and of guilt, the bare narration
of which makes the heart sick.” Ex-President Fillmore says
“that the Abolitionists in Congress had undone what the army
had done.”</p>

<p>The New York Express says: “Adjutant General Thomas
came to this city a day or two ago to make arrangements concerning
Confederate prisoners at Governor’s Island and Fort Lafayette.
After a thorough examination, it was found inexpedient to permit
any considerable number of Secessionists to occupy Governor’s
Island. It is one of the largest ordnance depots in the United
States. The arsenal on the island contains millions of dollars
worth of war material, and as the different fortifications constitute
a part of our harbor defences, and the armaments constantly ready
for use, a comparatively small number of Secessionists, should the
guard in any event be overpowered, could do a vast amount of
damage. The prisoners, numbering 1,100, have been taken to
Fort Delaware.” They have arrived.</p>

<p><i>July 16th.</i> The papers report the thermometer at 90° in the
shade. It must be 100° in the room in which we are confined.
We are losing flesh and health rapidly. A call for a mass meeting
in New Jersey says, among other things: “While the waning
ranks of the rebels are furnished by conscription, let it be our boast
that we defend the nation by the heroic volunteer.” The New
York Tribune says: “There are upwards of three thousand
prisoners on that island, (Pea Patch Island,) among which is the
notorious Colonel Pettigrew. Colonel Gibson, with a sufficient
force at his command, has charge of the prisoners. One of the
finest forts in the country is being constructed on that island. The
island is located forty miles south of Philadelphia, and two and a
half from the nearest point of the main land.” A correspondent
of the Buffalo Express, writing from Old Point Comfort, under
date of July 4th, says:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span> “The 44th, (Ellsworth Avengers,) which
I persist in calling the finest regiment that ever took the field, is a
mere wreck. On Wednesday, after the last of their many fights,
they stacked arms with only 90 muskets—a sad remainder of the
original 1,040 men. Of the greater portion, some are killed, more
are wounded, and still more are home on sick leave.”</p>

<p>Horace Greeley says: “The proper cure for a guerilla is hemp,
looped over the first tree, guerilla pendant.” The following also
is from that infamous sheet, the New York Tribune: “There is
much excitement in Nashville, and there is great fear of a rebel attack
on that city. At the Murfreesboro’ fight $30,000 worth of
army stores were lost on our side. The Pennsylvania 7th lost 200
men—only three or four of their officers escaped. <em>The rebel loss
is said to be greater than ours.</em>” The latter is what the Yankees
always record. In all their reports of battles they wind up by saying,
“the rebel loss is said to be greater than ours.” In the case
above referred to, a more disgraceful lie was never recorded even
by a Yankee.</p>

<p>The Northern papers stated a week ago, and we were assured,
that a general exchange of prisoners had been agreed upon by the
two governments. In yesterday’s Tribune I find the following:
“We are assured that the report of an agreement for a general exchange
of prisoners is premature. Yet it is thought that both
sides will favor some immediate arrangement.” The bill for the
admission of the “State of Western Virginia,” after a long discussion,
was yesterday adopted by a vote of 23 to 17. In the House
the Ways and Means Committee reported the Miscellaneous Appropriation
Bill, with the donation to Gales &amp; Seaton <em>stricken out</em>.
The Yankee Congress adjourned to-day.</p>

<p><i>July 17th.</i> From the Baltimore <i>Sun</i>, of July 12th, I extract:
“A Washington paper states that the government has agreed upon
a general exchange of prisoners of war, and that arrangements
will speedily be made for the sending South of the prisoners now
held on the seaboard. All the prisoners confined at New York
were taken on board a steamer yesterday.” A western correspondent
of a Yankee paper, under date of Vicksburg, July 7th, says:
“General Hindman is reported to be at Little Rock with a large
force. He has with him a million dollars in gold and silver, which
he obtained ‘by the authority of the sword’ from the banks in
Memphis. He is disliked by his troops for his oppressiveness and
tyranny. His last order was for the impressment of every man in
Arkansas capable of bearing arms. This, of course, has created a
great deal of indignation among the people, and has made many
enemies to the cause of Secession. Hindman, as a General, is the
same swaggering bombast that he was as a Congressman. In his
own town of Helena he is despised worse than the meanest and
most contemptible citizen. He took advantage of the temporary
insanity of the people to put himself in a position that would not
have been assigned him at any time since. His debut in the rebellion
was made at the head of the “Hindman Legion,” which he
raised immediately after his return from Washington City, after
the secession of his gallant State.”</p>

<p>“Simon Cohen was arrested in Baltimore on Monday, by officer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
Scott, charged with displaying a Secession flag at his store, No.
185 Gay street. He was held for the action of the provost marshal.
Also, Leonard Strikpon spent the day at a lager beer saloon
on the Belair Road, and imbibed somewhat freely, so much so,
that he lost his senses, and hurrahed for Jeff. Davis. Officer Smith
took him into custody, and Justice Spicer sent him to jail in default
of bail to keep the peace.”—<cite>Baltimore News Sheet.</cite></p>

<p>Colonel Hanson, of Kentucky, was to-day transferred to Fort
Warren, according to his own request.</p>

<p><i>July 18th.</i> Anniversary of the battle at Bull Run. The prisoners
seem in fine spirits to-day in recollection of our victory a year
ago, though it’s hard to be cheerful in a room so dull as the one
in which we are confined! There is nothing in it that can
awaken the mind or call up a sentiment of solace! “The dawning
of morn, the daylight sinking,” generally furnishes us the
same monotony! But the moody silence our thoughts shed over
us in this comfortless confinement is often broken by the cheerful
songs of Lieutenant S., who forces us to ask ourselves,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">“Why, soldiers, why</div>
   <div class="verse">Should we be melancholy, boys?”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The daily promises of “Old Gip,” that Jackson’s men shall be
paroled in a few days, are not believed; yet, with this unbelief is
blended a ray of hope, and for one I say, “for God’s sake destroy
not the hopes that man holds out to me; upon them I live.” Dr.
Reid says if we cannot imbibe the spirit, it is often profitable to
put on the appearance of cheerfulness. “By <em>seeming</em> gay, we
grow to what we seem.”</p>

<p>Thousands of dollars worth of clothing have been sent to the
Confederate prisoners by Secessionists, and very little do they get.
“Old Gip” refuses to give it to many who are in a destitute condition,
but he makes the impression outside, that all clothing sent
to us by Secession friends is given to us. A box was sent to Captain
R. (a prisoner) with clothing in it, to distribute among the
destitute prisoners, but Gibson refused to allow him. The clothing
is given to Yankee soldiers. The Dutch Captain <i>Mtowlowski</i>
paid us a visit to-day. He is a florid, fat, happy-looking, short
fellow, with legs so thick, that they very much resemble an elephant’s.
His face is large and rosy, and its general expression a
mixture of good humor and inexhaustible drollery. He wears a
moustache <i lang="fr">a la militaire</i>. On the whole, he presents the appearance
of a migratory lager beer keg. He would be muscular, had
not lager beer enervated his strong build, by placing a superabundance
of useless fat where muscle ought to be. The Captain says
that he was a prisoner in Europe, and that our fare is a paradise to
what his was, which is very hard to believe.</p>

<p>To-day my thoughts have turned to my early friends—those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
who have been weighed in the balance and found not wanting.
The thoughts of early friendship! what a world of tender memory
they suggest. For what are all our later successes in life,
however bright out fortunes, compared with the early triumphs
of boyish days? Where, among the jealous rivalry of some, the
cold and half-wrung praise of others, the selfish and unsympathizing
regard of all, shall we find anything to repay us for the
swelling exstacy of our young hearts, as we pledged ourselves to
each other in prosperity or adversity in the noble bonds of friendship?
Some moments we have which half seem to realize our
early dreams of ambition, and rouse the spirit within us. But
what were all compared to our boyish glories—to the little world
of sympathy and love our early friendships teemed with as we
pledged ourselves to each other? No, the world has no requital
for this! It is like a bright day, which, as its glories gild the
east, display before us a whole world of beauty and promise.
Then our hopes have not withered—false friendships have not
scathed—cold, selfish interest has not yet hardened our hearts
or dried up our affections, and we are indeed happy; but equally,
like the burst of morning, it is short-lived and fleeting, and
equally does it pass away, never to return.</p>

<p><i>July 19th.</i> My thoughts this morning have been engrossed
upon the subject of being exchanged or paroled—on being
again among congenial friends in the “Old Dominion!” But
I shall no longer allow my fortune or lot to be the sport of my
temperament. I shall not give way to that April-day frame of
mind which is ever the jest and scoff of those hardier and
sterner natures, who, if never overjoyed by success, are never
much depressed by failure; for the glimpses of sunshine the
world has afforded me, fleeting and passing enough, in all conscience,
I am not so ungrateful as to repine, because it was not
permanent. On the other hand, I am thankful for those bright
hours, which, if nothing more, are, at least, delightful souvenirs.
They form the golden thread in the tangled web of our
existence, ever appearing amid the darker surface around, and
throwing a fair halo of brilliancy on what—without it—were
cold, bleak and barren.</p>

<p>Lieutenant -—-, since he has been in prison here, wrote to
his cousin at York, Pennsylvania, a friendly letter, and received
the following reply:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>—“Cousin, I can hardly call you dear
cousin, for were I in the Union army you might have shot me
if you would have had the chance, which I do think you would
do if you get the chance; so as it is your thoughts to kill all
Northern men that you can, relation or not, and which I do
think it is a shame for you to do, being as all your relations
lives in the North, and are all Union people, so far as I know
of, which place I seen yesterday you was born in twenty years
ago, and eighty years ago your grand father fought for the glorious
country, and now you want to turn right around to drive
it to nothing at the point of the bayonet, which I do think that
you are doing wrong. Had I a hold of you I know I would make
you git—if you was pressed into it I can forgive you, but if you
fight against this country free-hearted I can’t forgive you, and
don’t fear you neither. It is right that they have taken you a
prisoner, and I hope they will deal with you as they ought,
being as they have you, and all such friends and relations as I
have in the rebel army, if there are more of them. I hope in
some future day you may see how wrong you have done to
trample down that banner which waves over once so glorious a
country as this. Now, as a rebel, you want to destroy it.
Shame on you as a Christian, as you wanted to be in days gone
by. I still thought you had more respect for this country than
you show for up to this time. Think of this letter whenever you
write to me—think that you are writing to a Union cousin,
<em>which has more sense in his big toe than you have in your head</em>.
For me to come to see you is impossible for me to do. If you
was there, and I knowed you was doing write, I might come,
but so I cannot; and you must think hard of me for writing
such a letter to you, for I have no sympathy for a man that will
do such a villainous act as you have done to this country. If
you had any thoughts for yourself and your relations you might
have got out of that rascally rebel army as well as you have
got into it. Your relations that you enquire about are all well.
If I had Jeff Davis, and you together, I would hang both of
you. So now you can do as you please; you can write, or leave
it alone; but that is what I think of you. If you write, tell
me where your father is.</p>

<p class="psig">
J. S. B.”</p>

<p>This is the Lieutenant’s rejoinder:</p>

<p>“Cousin J., this is a wicked world, and there are many
strange people and funny things in it. Your recent letter
might be classed among the latter, if it were possible for a thing
to be curious, without possessing some interest. And now, for
yourself, you might be a strange man if you were not precisely
like all the rest of the cowards, “Full of sound and fury, and
doing nothing.” Why are you not in the army battling for that
glorious country which you charge your rebel cousin with attempting
to destroy. Your President wants men, and just such
laggards as yourself will compel a draft upon the whole people
before your army is complete. ’Tis nice talk and little labor to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
say pretty things about the cause in which you pretend to be
heartily enlisted with your <em>pen</em>; but before all the rebels are
destroyed, you may discover that many such windy patriots as
yourself will be required to lay aside the pen, and buckle on the
sword. The draft which will soon be resorted to in your State
may bring you into the field, and the fates of war may place you
in the hands of my government. Then, if you will let me hear
from you, I will teach you a Christian’s duty; and while you have
scoffed at my calamity, I will endeavor to alleviate your suffering,
not because you happen to be my cousin, but for the sake
of humanity. Before you write to me again, I would have you
leave off such vulgar notions as you now entertain of me and
my brother rebels. After nine days, even, a puppy’s eyes are
opened. May not cousin Josiah hope for light?”</p>

<p><i>Sunday, July 20th.</i> It is said that the small pox has broken
out in the barracks. There is certainly a case of small pox at
the upper part of the island, whither he has been taken from the
barracks.</p>

<p>The most insidious schemes are constantly resorted to by the
Yankees to lead men to take the oath of allegiance. Their present
condition is placed before them in colors as dark as they
are; and in contrast a most captivating picture of happy freedom,
in flowers of rhetoric, is presented to them, provided they
throw Secession to the winds, and assume the garb of “the
Union, the Constitution and the laws.” Gold is also offered
them as an inducement to become traitors. Very few, comparatively,
have been thus seduced to treason, and those few have
been mostly of Northern birth, or else outcasts from society at
home, who joined the army not from principle but from necessity.
On the contrary, to the large majority of the prisoners
these seductive devices are as the storm to the oak, which, though
it may scatter the leaves, and snap the smaller branches, serves
but to rivet the roots, and to harden and condense the fibres of
the tree.</p>

<p>Last night there was great excitement in the garrison on account
of the attempt of prisoners to escape. Several companies
were called out, and great noise prevailed, while getting the
men into line of battle. Cannon was turned on the barracks.
Several prisoners, I understand, escaped.</p>

<p><i>July 21st.</i> Anniversary of the battle of Manassas! The disturbance
last night has been denominated the “Pea Patch
battle.” Mysterious as it may seem, Captain S. succeeded to-day
in getting a bottle of whiskey, to the astonishment no less
than the delight of our mess. A quart of whiskey! How
charming to chase away dull care! The Captain brought it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
into the room, with a commingled air of joy and self congratulation,
as he exhibited the evidence of his prowess, while he repeated
the lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">“How sad and short were this life’s dull day,</div>
   <div class="verse">Were it not brightened with pleasure,</div>
   <div class="verse">I then, for my part, will sport it away</div>
   <div class="verse">In friendship, love, and of folly a measure.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Lieutenant D. said if he meant by folly the whiskey, he heartily
endorsed the sentiment, and with a general exchange of wit,
the bottle was soon discussed among so many.</p>

<p>A Baltimore paper states that “no little excitement was
created in Baltimore yesterday by the public display of a “Secesh
rag” by Miss Mattie Gilpin, daughter of John Gilpin, of
Elkton, Cecil county. Miss Gilpin was first observed passing
from the President street depot in company with her sister, and
in addition to the flag, which is about twenty inches in length,
she wore a large Secesh rosette on the bosom of her dress. Two
policemen followed them some distance, and finally took both
in custody, conducting them to Marshal Van Nastrand’s office.
A warrant was issued by Justice Hess, and after a long conversation
with the Marshal, in which Miss Gilpin manifested no
regret at the part she was playing, she was released on security
to await the action of the grand jury on the charge of violating
the treason act of the recent General Assembly of this State by
displaying a Secession flag with the view of exciting seditious
feelings.” The most important news to-day is, that Major General
Halleck has been called to Washington, and put in chief
command of all the armies of the Union. The tone of the papers,
however, indicate that this does not affect Generals McClellan
and Pope, who retain their present position.</p>

<p>The Tribune says: “General Pope’s advance, upon reaching
Gordonsville, destroyed all the railway material at hand. As a
great portion of the rebel supplies come by this route, the blow
to them will be a serious one.” The same paper says: “The
Richmond papers are much disturbed at the consolidation of the
army of Virginia. Pope is reckoned a fighting General—hence
their trouble.” General Pope has ordered his troops to subsist
on the enemy, but adds that any man who is loyal from the date
of the seizure of his property shall be paid. Dates from Fortress
Monroe, to Wednesday last, give no news from McClellan’s
army. “Cynthana, Kentucky, has been captured by the rebels
under Morgan.” The difficulty about the exchange of prisoners
seems to be about settled, if it be true, as reported in the papers,
that General Dix had a satisfactory interview with Gene<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>ral
Hill, and then went up the James River to have an interview
with General Lee to that end. The trouble all along has been
that the Yankees have been <em>fools</em> enough to suppose that they
might capture some of the leaders of our cause, and have the
pleasure of hanging them, or exercising their malice in some
other way, and they know that the Confederate Government will
not exchange, except in prospective or upon a cartel, that will
occasion no trouble hereafter, by adopting the principle of the
war of 1812. It is all a humbug about General Buckner standing
in the way of exchange, for he has been treated as a <em>prisoner
of war</em>; and what objection, in a civilized warfare, can they
have to exchange him with the other prisoners of war?</p>

<p><i>July 22d.</i> A Pennsylvania soldier Writes from Tuscumbia,
Alabama, to the Philadelphia “Evening Bulletin:” “The people
are, of course, very extensive slaveholders, few of them owning
less than eighty slaves. Of course they are, without exception,
the rankest kind of Secessionists, and bestow upon us looks
anything but affectionate as we pass along. One old rebel, in
whose clover meadow we encamped on our last day’s march,
perfectly raved at the damned Yankees. His slaves were out in
the cornfield when we came, and he ordered them in, and told
them he would whip them within an inch of their lives if they
attempted to escape.”</p>

<p>The noise and bombast of the Yankee editors over victories,
large or small, or oftener over defeats, (for they always have
some excuse other than cowardice,) is most remarkable and
illaudable. For instance, General Jackson’s army advanced
upon Front Royal, and the first Maryland and Wheat’s battalion
on our side took prisoners, all but fifteen of the first Maryland
and the Vermont cavalry, on the Yankee side. This the
Yankee papers most plausibly distorted into a Confederate defeat,
as it “placed Jackson in a position from which he cannot
escape.” The sequel has proved that Jackson not only escaped,
but whipped Banks most completely at Winchester, Fremont at
Port Republic, and McDowell and Shields at Cross Keyes. The
Yankees are ever bragging about their grand army—the number
of their men. While boasting what they are going to do in
one breath with this “grand army,” with the next, they call for
volunteers.</p>

<p>The Wheeling Intelligencer says: “All the merchants in the
city, except one, have taken the oath of allegiance. One physician,
enjoying a large practice, gave it up, rather than take
the oath.” Nearly all the Virginia merchants had left before
the Yankees had the power to offer the insult. The physician,
who would not take the oath of allegiance, is Dr. Hughes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
The merchants, who did take it, had the alternative of taking
the oath or being imprisoned, and lose all their property. It
is hard for a man to work all his life, and then to give up all
and go to prison, leaving his family destitute. The merchants
took the oath <em>under protest</em>. The abolition editor does not
state this however, for the object of the Yankees is to deceive,
and such a mark of magnanimity would not be in accordance
with their character. Nearly all the regiments, which the bogus
Pierpont government call Virginia regiments, are filled with
Ohio Abolitionists.</p>

<p>“A perfect love of a man” is Parson Brownlow. The Louisville
Journal says: “He has repeatedly assured us that he
never swore an oath, never played a card, never took a drink of
liquor, never went to the theatre, never attended a horse-race,
never told a lie, never broke the Sabbath, never voted the Democratic
ticket, never wore whiskers, and never kissed any woman
but his wife.” He is a black-hearted traitor, besides being
an unprincipled liar.</p>

<p>A Western editor says his paper is located immediately over a
<em>recruiting</em> office, and that the fifing and drumming “drives
everything out of his head.” What a scampering there must
be over his shirt collar!</p>

<p>All the Yankees talk about is “the Union and its laws.” Of
all injustice, that is the greatest which goes under the name of
law; and of all sorts of tyranny, the forcing of the letter of the
law against the equity is the most insupportable.</p>

<p>Many Yankee soldiers have assured me that they entered the
army while intoxicated with drink, being victims of the wiles of
those who do not scruple to do anything in their mad efforts to
conquer the South. Wrong being at the root of their great
armies, has caused them so often to bite the dust before inferior
numbers:</p>

<p><i>July 25th.</i> Gold to-day is a peg higher, closing at 120⅛, with
a sharp demand for export. Flour, wheat and corn, following
the law of attraction, are “up” too. Inflation is the order of
the day, and under the exhilarating influence of plenty of paper
money, nobody appears to dream of the possibility that the
bubble is ever going to burst. I glean the following from Northern
papers: The news from Louisville, Kentucky, concerning
Morgan’s movements is, that between Crab Orchard and London
he destroyed several wagons of a Federal train destined for
General Morgan’s command at Cumberland Gap. Of course
the wagons, whose number is indefinitely stated, were not empty
ones, but whether they contained commissary stores, or material
of war, is not mentioned. The “Courier” and “Eugene,”
whilst ascending Green River, Kentucky, with troops, were fired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
into by a party of cavalry. At McAllister’s landing, two miles
beyond Newburg, Indiana, the steamer Commercial was also
attacked in a similar manner; whilst at Randolph, Missouri, the
Belle, on her way from Memphis to St. Louis, was likewise fired
upon. “The result,” we are told, “was unknown.” At Hudson,
Missouri, Porter’s guerrillas were attacked and routed by a
detachment of Federal cavalry under Colonel McNeill. The
Federal loss is set down at fifteen killed and thirty wounded.
The guerrilla loss is said to be much heavier. There was renewed
excitement at Nashville, Tennessee, on Monday evening
last—the Federal pickets on the Lebanon having been captured
by the guerrillas under Colonel Forrest, who was reported to be
in force within five miles of the city. The Confederates have
also broken up the railway communication between Corinth and
Tuscumbia. As the Tennessee river is no longer navigable, in
consequence of the low stage of water, great difficulty, it is
said, will be experienced in providing with adequate supplies
those portions of Buell’s army which are at or near Tuscumbia.</p>

<p>We know but little concerning the present condition of the
army now encamped under cover of the gunboats on the James
river, beyond what is furnished by the correspondents of Northern
journals. From these sources, however, we learn that the
furlough fever has somewhat abated, that many of those who
contemplated asking for leave of absence have concluded to remain,
but that many other officers, surfeited with war and its
horrors, have sent in their resignations, and “want to go home.”
The Confederates are reported to be in considerable force on
both sides of the James river, from four to eight miles below
the mouth of the Chickahominy, whilst above, at Turkey Island
Bend, Curl’s Neck, and at Dutch Gap, they are constructing
large and massive batteries. On several occasions the gun boats
have driven them from their work, but it was resumed again as
soon as the boats retired, and the batteries are now supposed to
be “fully prepared, equipped, and ready for future action.” It
is not surprising, then, that it should be rumored “that the
troops would receive orders, in the course of a few days, to evacuate
their present position,” where they suffer terribly for want
of pure and wholesome water, and are weakened down with
diarrhœa and dysentery. It seems scarcely probable, however,
that McClellan will abandon the “secure” position he has already
sacrificed so much to attain. The report to that effect is,
nevertheless, gravely announced by the correspondent of the
Philadelphia Enquirer, and is reproduced, without comment, in
the New York papers. The War Department has issued an order
authorizing the military commanders within the States of
Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Loui<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>siana,
Texas and Arkansas, to seize any real or personal property
which may be necessary or convenient for their respective commands,
and also to destroy property for military purposes. It
is further ordered that the negroes within and from the above
States shall be employed as laborers for military purposes, giving
them reasonable compensation for their services, and that a
record shall be kept, showing from whom the property and persons
are taken, as a basis upon which compensation can be made
in proper cases.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, July 26th.</i> The papers say that McClellan remains
quiet, while his officers are resigning as fast as they can.
He may fly from our brave soldiers, and seek shelter under his
gunboats, but he cannot flee from the retributive justice of heaven,
let him go where he may:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">“In vain he flies—the furies still pursue.</div>
   <div class="verse">Avenging justice on the murderer’s track</div>
   <div class="verse">Follows to claim her due.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is with a loathing, sickening sensation, similar to that with
which men regard the bloated toad or slimy reptile, that I view
the Yankee officials who come round daily, often with no other
object but to tantalize the prisoners. The idea that their treasonable
invasion of the just rights of the South has placed me
in my present position, sends the warm blood rushing to my
heart and brain—my shattered nerves resume their elasticity,
and feel as if they were suddenly transformed to steel. More
than once I have clenched my hands with nervous impatience,
till the nails almost cut the flesh, for the Yankees, from their
very nature, seem to feel an almost inhuman joy in contemplating
our imprisonment; and what is more calculated to vex?
We were allowed to go a swimming this evening. Saw two
young ladies—nearer than I have seen a lady for two months,
for they passed directly by us. They were, indeed, fair and
good-looking, but as they did not condescend to notice me:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">“Why should I, wasting in despair,</div>
   <div class="verse">Die because a woman’s fair;</div>
   <div class="verse">What care I how fair she be,</div>
   <div class="verse">If she be not fair to me.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It was told us on Friday that we would certainly be sent to
Dixie to-day, but to-day they say we are not to go until Monday.
I believe the sole delight of the Yankee authorities here
is to tantalize us as much as they can. I read somewhere that
the word tantalize thus originated—a man named Tantalus had
been found guilty of a crime in Germany, and as a punishment
for the same he was denied water for a certain length of time,
although water, by machinery, passed nearer every moment to
his parched lips—every moment the cooling draught suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
swept by him in pipes, and became more and more close to his
mouth, but yet never near enough for him to quench his thirst.
Afterwards whenever a man had expectations of a flattering nature
held out to him and was frustrated, he was said to be tantalized.
Truly, the Yankees are fond of tantalizing—they like
to deceive and tyrannize over those in their power. All cowards
are prone to do the same.</p>

<p>On the 15th of July, Sergeant J. J. Cox, first battalion Louisiana
volunteers, and John A. Toole, 9th Virginia cavalry, made
their escape from Fort Delaware under the following circumstances:
At 8 o’clock, P.M., when the sergeants were calling
the roll in the enclosure, they a squeezed out of the apertures left
for the passage of air throughout the quarters, and concealed
themselves in the long grass outside the barracks. They now
had about ten paces to crawl in order to reach the path on which
the sentry walked, and they passed this point in safety and unobserved
by the sentinel, with their knives between their teeth,
ready to use at any moment. They then crossed the moat and
embankment in safety. It was now seventy-five yards to the
river. On the way there they discovered a board on which they
tied their clothes. As they were about to get into the water,
they saw a boat full (as they supposed) of soldiers rowing towards
the shore, and in about ten minutes another came. This
delayed them an hour, when they leaped into the water, and
swam half way across the river. Here a government transport
passed so close to them that they could discern every rope on
board. Having eluded this boat they had no further trouble,
and reached the shore between Delaware City and New Castle
on the marsh, after being five or six hours in the water, and
having swam a distance of three and a half miles on a board!
They remained on the marsh until the night of the 16th, when
they started on their journey South—paused the town of St.
George, Delaware, the same night. They went to Baltimore
and Washington to look round, and from the latter they made
their way to Dixie, easy enough, in the character of stock buyers.</p>

<p><i>July 28th.</i> This day has been spent in reading the “life of
Washington,” loaned me by a fellow-prisoner. The war for
independence has always been considered the heroic age in American
history, and while many despaired of peace ever again
smiling upon the land, Washington placed his confidence in
God, and overcame all difficulties. In September, 1775, Washington
wrote in relation to a proposed attack upon the enemy at
Boston and Roxbury: “The success of such an enterprise, I well
know, <em>depends on the All-wise disposer of events</em>, and it is not
within the reach of human wisdom to foretell the result, &amp;c.” In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
January, 1776, he wrote: “For more than two months I have
scarcely emerged from one difficulty before I have plunged into
another. How it will end God in his great goodness will direct.”
Those who fight the battles of a country may derive their loftiest
inspirations from trust in providence. In July, 1775,
Washington said in an order to the troops: “The fate of unborn
millions will now depend, under God, on the courage and
conduct of this army. Let us rely upon the goodness of the
cause, and the aid of the Supreme Being, in whose hands victory
is.”</p>

<p><i>July 29th, 30th and 31st.</i> Nothing of interest enough to record
has transpired during the past three days, unless it be the
arrival of transport boats to convey us to “Dixie,” which latter
is the only evidence to our minds that we are really to be
exchanged, for we have ceased to believe the Yankees any
longer. And I might add, the general happiness manifested by
the prisoners in anticipation of once more realizing that freedom
which allows one to move about at pleasure, and untrammelled
by a sentinel at every step. No one can entertain an adequate
idea of what liberty is, until he has been confined in a Yankee
prison, and then he will understand both liberty and tyranny.</p>

<p><i>August 1st.</i> About three thousand Confederates were put
on board boats to-day, and started for the South—landed at
“Aiken’s Landing,” August 5th.</p>

<p>My prison experience has taught me that the Yankees are
one grand bundle of lies and inconsistencies. The newspapers,
particularly, have begun, and kept up, a wholsale system of lying,
under the military censorship and direction of the Secretary
of War. In spite of their disclaimers to the contrary,
their own acts and words betray their purpose to steal all the
negroes they can. It is true that some have pleaded, and are
now pleading for peace under the old government, offering the
South all she ever had, and claiming nothing that is not common
to all. But this is simply because they have seen the folly
of their undertaking, and would like now to slip out of the difficulty,
especially since they believe they have about as many
slaves as they will probably get. But those who are now causing
all the bloodshed around us, will, if they persist, find the
bounds of slavery yet spread beyond limits heretofore held. The
Confederate Government, however, is fighting for <em>Constitutional
Liberty</em>—the liberty of our forefathers against all things, and
nothing but annihilation can prevent them from upholding it;
and to the Yankees it may be said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">“The purpose you undertake is dangerous;</div>
   <div class="verse">The friends you have named uncertain;</div>
   <div class="verse">The time itself unsorted;</div>
   <div class="verse">And your whole plot too light for the counterpoise of so great an opposition.”</div>
